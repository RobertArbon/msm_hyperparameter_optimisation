The mechanism of signaling transduction in the PtAu1a LOV domain (AuLOV) including flanking helices remains unclear because of this dissimilarity, which hinders the study of PtAu1a as an optogenetic tool. To clarify this mechanism, we employed a combination of tree-based machine learning models, Markov state models, machine-learning-based community analysis, and transition path theory to quantitatively analyze the allosteric process. Our results are in good agreement with the reported experimental findings and reveal a previously overlooked C alpha helix and protein linkers as important in promoting the protein conformational changes. This integrated approach can be considered as a general workflow and applied on other allosteric proteins to provide detailed information about their allosteric mechanisms.","[Tian, Hao; Trozzi, Francesco; Zoltowski, Brian D.; Tao, Peng] Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Ctr Res Comp, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Tao, P (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Ctr Res Comp, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",ptao@smu.edu,"Tao, Peng/H-4925-2014","Tao, Peng/0000-0002-2488-0239; Tian, Hao/0000-0002-0186-9811","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R15GM122013, R15GM109282]","We gratefully acknowledge funding sources, including NIH research grant R15GM122013 to P.T. and NIH research grant R15GM109282 to B.D.Z.

However, how glycosylase can efficiently and accurately recognize DNA lesions across the enormous DNA genome remains elusive. It has been hypothesized that glycosylase translocates along the DNA by alternating between a fast but low-accuracy diffusion mode and a slow but high-accuracy mode when searching for DNA lesions. However, the slow mode has not been successfully characterized due to the limitation in the spatial and temporal resolutions of current experimental techniques. Using a newly developed scan- ning fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) platform, we were able to observe both slow and fast modes of glycosylase AlkD translocating on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), reaching the temporal resolution of microsecond and spatial resolution of subnanometer. The underlying molecular mechanism of the slow mode was further elucidated by Markov state model built from extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that in the slow mode, AIkD follows an asymmetric diffusion pathway, i.e., rotation fol- lowed by translation. Furthermore, the essential role of Y27 in AlkD diffusion dynamics was identified both experimentally and computationally. Our results provided mechanistic insights on how conformational dynamics of AlkD-dsDNA complex coordinate different diffusion modes to accomplish the search for DNA lesions with high efficiency and accuracy. We anticipate that the mechanism adopted by AlkD to search for DNA lesions could be a general one utilized by other glycosylases and DNA binding proteins.","[Peng, Sijia; Chen, Chunlai] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Struct Biol, Beijing Frontier Res Ctr Biol Struct, Sch Life Sci,Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sc, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaowei; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Dept Chem,Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Struct Chem, Fujian Inst Res Struct Matter, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China; [He, Shanshan; Zhao, Xin Sheng] Peking Univ, State Key Lab Struct Chem Unstable & Stable Speci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Dept Chem Biol,Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Shanshan; Zhao, Xin Sheng] Peking Univ, Biomed Pioneering Innovat Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chen, CL (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Struct Biol, Beijing Frontier Res Ctr Biol Struct, Sch Life Sci,Tsinghua Peking Joint Ctr Life Sc, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Dept Chem,Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.; Zhang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Struct Chem, Fujian Inst Res Struct Matter, Fuzhou 350002, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Zhao, XS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, State Key Lab Struct Chem Unstable & Stable Speci, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Dept Chem Biol,Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Zhao, XS (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Biomed Pioneering Innovat Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Zhang, L (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",luzhang@fjirsm.ac.cn; zhaoxs@pku.edu.cn; xuhuihuang@ust.hk; chunlai@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Huang, Xuhui/0000-0002-7119-9358; Zhang, Lu/0000-0002-8640-1301","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21922704, 21877069, 31570754, 21233002, 21521003, 21733007, 21803071]; National 1000 Youth Talents Program of China; Hong Kong Research Grant CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [16307718, 16318816, AoE/P-705/16, T13-605/18-W]","This project was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 21922704, 21877069, and 31570754 to C.C.; 21233002 and 21521003 to X.S.Z.; and 21733007 and 21803071 to L.Z.), the National 1000 Youth Talents Program of China to L.Z., and Hong Kong Research Grant Council (Grants 16307718, 16318816, AoE/P-705/16, and T13-605/18-W to X.H.).",,67,0,0,1,1,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Data collated from protein dynamics can be translated into useful statistics that can be exploited to sieve thermodynamics and kinetics crucial for the elucidation of mechanisms responsible for the modulation of biological processes such as protein-ligand binding and protein-protein association. Continuous modernization of simulation tools enables accurate prediction and characterization of the aforementioned mechanisms and these qualities are highly beneficial for the expedition of drug development when effectively applied to structure-based drug design (SBDD). In this review, current all-atom MD simulation methods, with focus on enhanced sampling techniques, utilized to examine protein structure, dynamics, and functions are discussed. This review will pivot around computer calculations of protein-ligand and protein-protein systems with applications to SBDD. In addition, we will also be highlighting limitations faced by current simulation tools as well as the improvements that have been made to ameliorate their efficiency.","[Choi, Sun] Ewha Womans Univ, Coll Pharm, Seoul 03760, South Korea; Ewha Womans Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Seoul 03760, South Korea","Choi, S (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Coll Pharm, Seoul 03760, South Korea.",raudah@ewha.ac.kr; dsuh@ewha.ac.kr; sunchoi@ewha.ac.kr,,"Choi, Sun/0000-0002-7669-7954","Bio and Medical Technology Development Program - Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) [NRF-2019M3E5D4065251]; Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), Medical Research Center (MRC) grant [2018R1A5A2025286]; Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) through the Mid-career Researcher Program [NRF-2017R1A2B4010084]; RP-Grant 2020 of EwhaWomans University","This work was supported by Bio and Medical Technology Development Program (NRF-2019M3E5D4065251) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), Medical Research Center (MRC) grant (No. 2018R1A5A2025286), and the Mid-career Researcher Program (NRF-2017R1A2B4010084).

However, the microscopic description of conformational dynamics-coupled ligand binding remains a challenge. In this study, we integrate molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state model (MSM) analysis and experimental methods to characterize the conformational dynamics of ligand-bound glutamine binding protein (GlnBP). We show that ligand-bound GlnBP has high conformational flexibility and additional metastable binding sites, presenting a more complex energy landscape than the scenario in the absence of ligand. The diverse conformations of GlnBP demonstrate different binding affinities and entail complex transition kinetics, implicating a concerted ligand binding mechanism. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements and mutagenesis experiments are performed to validate our MSM-derived structure ensemble as well as the binding mechanism. Collectively, our study provides deeper insights into the protein dynamics-coupled ligand binding, revealing an intricate regulatory network underlying the apparent binding affinity. Zhang, Wu, Feng et al. show that ligand-bound glutamine binding protein assumes multiple metastable binding sites, presenting a more dynamic energy landscape than its ligand-free form.

Spike glycoprotein, especially the partially open state of S1 subunit, in SARS-CoV-2 is considered vital for its infection with human host cell. However, the mechanism elucidating the transition from the closed state to the partially open state still remains unclear. In this study, we applied a series of computational methods, including Markov state model, transition path theory and random forest to analyze the S1 motion. Our results showed a promising complete conformational movement of the receptor-binding domain, from buried, partially open, to detached states. We also estimated the transition probability among these states. Based on the asymmetry in both the dynamics behavior and the accumulated alpha carbon (C alpha) importance, we further suggested a relation among chains in the trimer spike protein, which leads to a deeper understanding on protein motions of the S1 subunit.

The unifying theme and overarching goal of allosteric regulation studies in recent years have been integration between emerging experiment and computational approaches and technologies to advance quantitative characterization of allosteric mechanisms in proteins. Despite significant advances, the quantitative characterization and reliable prediction of functional allosteric states, interactions, and mechanisms continue to present highly challenging problems in the field. In this review, we discuss simulation-based multiscale approaches, experiment-informed Markovian models, and network modeling of allostery and information-theoretical approaches that can describe the thermodynamics and hierarchy allosteric states and the molecular basis of allosteric mechanisms. The wealth of structural and functional information along with diversity and complexity of allosteric mechanisms in therapeutically important protein families have provided a well-suited platform for development of data-driven research strategies. Data-centric integration of chemistry, biology and computer science using artificial intelligence technologies has gained a significant momentum and at the forefront of many cross-disciplinary efforts. We discuss new developments in the machine learning field and the emergence of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning applications in modeling of molecular mechanisms and allosteric proteins. The experiment-guided integrated approaches empowered by recent advances in multiscale modeling, network science, and machine learning can lead to more reliable prediction of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and discovery of allosteric modulators for therapeutically important protein targets.","[Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Agajanian, Steve] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Grad Program Computat & Data Sci, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Verkhivker, Gennady M.] Chapman Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Biomed & Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92618 USA; [Hu, Guang] Soochow Univ, Sch Biol & Basic Med Sci, Dept Bioinformat, Ctr Syst Biol, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Tao, Peng] Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Sci Computat, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX USA","Verkhivker, GM (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Grad Program Computat & Data Sci, Orange, CA 92866 USA.; Verkhivker, GM (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Biomed & Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92618 USA.",verkhivk@chapman.edu,,,Chapman University,This work was partly supported by institutional funding from Chapman University.,,355,0,0,9,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-889X,,FRONT MOL BIOSCI,Front.

Markov State Models (MSMs) provide a powerful approach to study these dynamic processes by predicting long time scale dynamics based on many short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In an MSM, protein dynamics are modeled as a kinetic process consisting of a series of Markovian transitions between different conformational states at discrete time intervals (called lag time). To achieve this, a master equation must be constructed with a sufficiently long lag time to allow interstate transitions to become truly Markovian. This imposes a major challenge for MSM studies of proteins since the lag time is bound by the length of relatively short MD simulations available to estimate the frequency of transitions. Here, we show how one can employ the generalized master equation formalism to obtain an exact description of protein conformational dynamics both at short and long time scales without the time resolution restrictions imposed by the MSM lag time. Using a simple kinetic model, alanine dipeptide, and WW domain, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct these quasi-Markov State Models (qMSMs) using MD simulations that are 5-10 times shorter than those required by MSMs. These qMSMs only contain a handful of metastable states and, thus, can greatly facilitate the interpretation of mechanisms associated with protein dynamics. A qMSM opens the door to the study of conformational changes of complex biomolecules where a Markovian model with a few states is often difficult to construct due to the limited length of available MD simulations.","[Cao, Siqin; Wang, Wei; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Montoya-Castillo, Andres; Markland, Thomas E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hitech Pk, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Markland, TE (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hitech Pk, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",tmarkland@stanford.edu; xuhuihuang@ust.hk,,"Huang, Xuhui/0000-0002-7119-9358; Markland, Thomas/0000-0002-2747-0518","Hong Kong Research Grant CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [16303919, AoE/P-705/16]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20170413173837121]; Innovation and Technology Commission [ITCPD/17-9]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0020203]; Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program","X.H. and S.C. were supported by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council (Grant Nos. 16303919 and AoE/P-705/16), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (Grant No. JCYJ20170413173837121), and the Innovation and Technology Commission (Grant No. ITCPD/17-9).

Their soluble isoforms, functioning as decoy receptors, contain only the ectodomain. Whether the ectodomains of cytokine receptors at the membrane exhibit different conformational dynamics from their soluble forms is unknown. Using Stimulation-2 (ST2) as an example, we performed microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the conformational dynamics of the soluble and the membrane-bound ST2 (sST2 and ST2). Combined use of accelerated and conventional MD simulations enabled extensive sampling of the conformational space of sST2 for comparison with ST2. Using the interdomain loop conformation as the reaction coordinate, we built a Markov State Model to determine the slowest implied timescale of the conformational transition in sST2 and ST2. We found that the ectodomain of ST2 undergoes slower conformational relaxation but exhibits a faster rate of conformational transition in a more restricted conformational space than sST2. Analyses of the relaxed conformations of ST2 further suggest important contributions of interdomain salt-bridge interactions to the stabilization of different ST2 conformations. Our study elucidates differential conformational properties between sST2 and ST2 that may be exploited for devising strategies to selectively target each isoform.","[Yang, Chao-Yie] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Yang, CY (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cyang26@uthsc.edu,"Yang, Chao-Yie/A-3930-2015","Yang, Chao-Yie/0000-0002-5445-0109",National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01HL141432]; University of Tennessee Health Science Center,This work was supported in part from the National Institute of Health (R01HL141432) and the startup fund from University of Tennessee Health Science Center.

How the PKA-C/PKI complex assembles and recognizes CRM1/RanGTP is not well understood. Using NMR, SAXS, fluorescence, metadynamics, and Markov model analysis, we determined the multi-state recognition pathway for PKI. After a fast binding step in which PKA-C selects PKI's most competent conformations, PKI folds upon binding through a slow conformational rearrangement within the enzyme's binding pocket. The high-affinity and pseudo-substrate regions of PKI become more structured and the transient interactions with the kinase augment the helical content of the nuclear export sequence, which is then poised to recruit the CRM1/RanGTP complex for nuclear translocation. The multistate binding mechanism featured by PKA-C/PKI complex represents a paradigm on how disordered, ancillary proteins (or protein domains) are able to operate multiple functions such as inhibiting the kinase while recruiting other regulatory proteins for nuclear export.","[Olivieri, Cristina; Manu, V.

The reversed cone-like molecular shape of CD9 generates membrane curvature in the crystalline lipid layers, which explains the CD9 localization in regions with high membrane curvature and its implications in membrane remodeling.

In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLU(ex). Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLU(ex) away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLU(ex) results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low (similar to 1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLU(ex) rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population (similar to 1%), is only accessible when GLU(ex) is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLU(ex) protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations. Author summary In contrast to sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-selective ion channels, the roles of chloride-selective ion channels in mammalian physiology have been studied much less and are not sufficiently understood, despite known associations of chloride-channel defects with a variety of pathological conditions. CLC-2 is a voltage-activated chloride channel (one of 9 human CLC homologs) with broad tissue and organ distribution. In this work, we use simulations to model the conformational dynamics of the CLC-2 chloride ion channel selectivity filter (SF), which is the part of the protein that controls whether the channel is in an ion-conducting or non-conducting state. Our analysis identifies four primary conformational states and a specific progression through these states. Our results are consistent with structural and functional data in the literature and provide a high-resolution model for guiding further studies of CLC-2. These results will inform our understanding of how CLC-2 regulates electrical activity and ion homeostasis in the many tissues where it is expressed.","[McKiernan, Keri A.; Koster, Anna K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Koster, Anna K.; Maduke, Merritt] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,"Pande, Vijay/0000-0003-2774-1178; McKiernan, Keri/0000-0002-4414-2567; Koster, Anna/0000-0001-8833-5339","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U19 AI109662, 2R01GM062868, R01GM113195]; Stanford Bio-X seed grant; Center for Molecular Analysis and Design (CMAD); Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship (SIGF) through the Stanford ChEM-H Institute (Chemistry, Engineering, & Medicine for Human Health)","We acknowledge funding from NIH grants U19 AI109662 and 2R01GM062868 (VSP), R01GM113195 (MM), from a Stanford Bio-X seed grant (MM, and VSP), and support from the Center for Molecular Analysis and Design (CMAD).

In hypoxia, HIF-1 alpha binds TAZ1 to control the transcription of adaptive genes critical for the recovery from hypoxic stress. CITED2 acts as the negative feedback regulator to rapidly displace HIF-1 alpha and efficiently attenuate the hypoxic response. Though CITED2 and HIF-1 alpha have the same dissociation constant (K-d = 10 nM) in their binary complexes with TAZ1, CITED2 is much more competitive than HIF-1 alpha upon binding the same target TAZ1 in ternary (Berlow et al.

Here we demonstrate that a simple coarse-grained model can recapitulate this negative allosteric effect and provide detailed physical insights into the displacement mechanism. We find that long-range electrostatic forces are essential for the efficient displacement of HIF-1 alpha by CITED2. The strong electrostatic interactions between CITED2 and TAZ1, along with the unique binding mode, make CITED2 much more competitive than HIF-1 alpha in binding TAZ1.","[Wang, Yanming; Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Brooks, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Brooks, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",brookscl@umich.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 1506273],The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation under Grant CHE 1506273.,,21,1,1,4,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7185,,,J PHYS CHEM LETT,J.

The proliferation of novel computational approaches for predicting ligand-protein interactions and binding using dynamic and network-centric perspectives has led to new insights into allosteric mechanisms and facilitated computer-based discovery of allosteric drugs. Although no absolute method of experimental and in silico allosteric drug/site discovery exists, current methods are still being improved. As such, the critical analysis and integration of established approaches into robust, reproducible, and customizable computational pipelines with experimental feedback could make allosteric drug discovery more efficient and reliable. In this article, we review computational approaches for allosteric drug discovery and discuss how these tools can be utilized to develop consensus workflows for in silico identification of allosteric sites and modulators with some applications to pathogen resistance and precision medicine. The emerging realization that allosteric modulators can exploit distinct regulatory mechanisms and can provide access to targeted modulation of protein activities could open opportunities for probing biological processes and in silico design of drug combinations with improved therapeutic indices and a broad range of activities.","[Amamuddy, Olivier Sheik; Veldman, Wayde; Manyumwa, Colleen; Khairallah, Afrah; Bishop, Ozlem Tastan] Rhodes Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Res Unit Bioinformat RUBi, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Agajanian, Steve; Oluyemi, Odeyemi; Verkhivker, Gennady M.] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Keck Ctr Sci & Engn, Grad Program Computat & Data Sci, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA; [Verkhivker, Gennady M.] Chapman Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Biomed & Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92618 USA","Bishop, OT (corresponding author), Rhodes Univ, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Res Unit Bioinformat RUBi, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.; Verkhivker, GM (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Keck Ctr Sci & Engn, Grad Program Computat & Data Sci, One Univ Dr, Orange, CA 92866 USA.; Verkhivker, GM (corresponding author), Chapman Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Biomed & Pharmaceut Sci, Irvine, CA 92618 USA.",oliserand@gmail.com; wamiveld@gmail.com; colleen.manyumwa06@gmail.com; afrahkhairalla@gmail.com; agaja102@mail.chapman.edu; odeye100@mail.chapman.edu; verkhivk@chapman.edu; O.TastanBishop@ru.ac.za,"Verkhivker, Gennady/V-9404-2018; Tastan Bishop, Ozlem/J-3084-2016","Verkhivker, Gennady/0000-0002-4507-4471; Khairallah, Afrah/0000-0003-4838-7032; Veldman, Wayde/0000-0002-2747-7146; Manyumwa, Colleen/0000-0002-8720-9733; Tastan Bishop, Ozlem/0000-0001-6861-7849; Sheik Amamuddy, Olivier/0000-0002-1781-1382","National Institutes of Health Common FundUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U41HG006941]; National Research Foundation (NRF) South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [105267]; CSIR DST Interbursary Support (IBS); Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (OWSD); Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Kay Family Foundation [A20-0032]; Grand Challenges Africa program [GCA/DD/rnd3/023]; Grand Challenges Africa is a program of the African Academy of Sciences (AAS); Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA) platform, an initiative of the AAS; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), and Drug Discovery and Development Centre of University of Cape Town (H3D)","O.S.A. is funded as a postdoctoral fellow by H3ABioNet, which is supported by the National Institutes of Health Common Fund grant number (U41HG006941).

The molecular mechanism of the perception of BRs by the ectodomain of BRI1 remains not fully understood. It also remains elusive why a substantial difference in biological activity exists between the BRs. In this work, we study the binding mechanisms of the two most bioactive BRs, brassinolide (BLD) and castasterone (CAT), using molecular dynamics simulations. We report free-energy landscapes of the binding processes of both ligands, as well as detailed ligand binding pathways. Our results suggest that CAT has a lower binding affinity compared to BLD due to its inability to form hydrogen-bonding interactions with a tyrosine residue in the island domain of BRI1. We uncover a conserved nonproductive binding state for both BLD and CAT, which is more stable for CAT and may further contribute to the bioactivity difference. Finally, we validate past observations about the conformational restructuring and ordering of the island domain upon BLD binding. Overall, this study provides new insights into the fundamental mechanism of the perception of the two most bioactive BRs, which may create new avenues for genetic and agrochemical control of their signaling cascade.","[Aldukhi, Faisal; Zhao, Chuankai; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Moffett, Alexander S.; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Deb, Aniket] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Food Technol & Biochem Engn, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Shukla, Diwakar] Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Moffett, Alexander/0000-0003-1631-2722; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381; Zhao, Chuankai/0000-0002-6879-6514","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Blue Waters Student Internship Program - Shodor Education Foundation; Khorana Program for Scholars - Department of Biotechnology, Government of India; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research via the New Innovator Award in Food & Agriculture Research","The authors acknowledge the support from the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

A particularly useful strategy is to use molecular simulations as a modeling tool to interpret experimental measurements, and to use experimental data to refine our biophysical models. Thus, explicit integration and synergy between molecular simulations and experiments is fundamental for furthering our understanding of biological processes. This is especially true in the case where discrepancies between measured and simulated observables emerge. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the core ideas behind methods that were developed to improve the consistency between experimental information and numerical predictions. We distinguish between situations where experiments are used to refine our understanding and models of specific systems, and situations where experiments are used more generally to refine transferable models. We discuss different philosophies and attempt to unify them in a single framework. Until now, such integration between experiments and simulations have mostly been applied to equilibrium data, and we discuss more recent developments aimed to analyze time-dependent or time-resolved data.","[Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr; Bottaro, Sandro; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr; Bottaro, Sandro; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Struct Biophys, Fac Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bottaro, Sandro] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Atomist Simulat Lab, Genoa, Italy; [Larsen, Andreas Haahr] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Struct Bioinformat & Computat Biochem Unit, Oxford, England","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",lindorff@bio.ku.dk,"Larsen, Andreas Haahr/P-5655-2015","Larsen, Andreas Haahr/0000-0002-2230-2654",Lundbeck FoundationLundbeckfonden; NordForsk Nordic Neutron Science Programme; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation; Velux Foundations; Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk Foundation,"We acknowledge support by a grant from the Lundbeck Foundation to the BRAINSTRUC structural biology initiative, the NordForsk Nordic Neutron Science Programme, the Carlsberg Foundation, a grant from the Velux Foundations and a Hallas-Moller Stipend from the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

The latter finally promotes membrane fusion, likely via visiting a critical pre-hairpin state of gp41. The complete conformational dynamics of the pre-hairpin formation at atomic resolution, however, is still unknown. Here, by constructing a Markov state model based on the all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) with an aggregated simulation time of similar to 24 mu s, we reveal the gp41 refolding dynamics from pre-fusion to pre-hairpin state and the key metastable states involved. Moreover, we further explored the drug resistance mechanism of two C-terminal heptad repeat-derived gp41 inhibitors, T20 and sifuvirtide, based on the constructed inhibitor-bound gp41 pre-hairpin complexes. The results indicate that these two inhibitors have distinct binding sites on gp41 but share a common drug resistance region that usually exhibits a helical structure in the pre-hairpin state yet adopts various secondary structures in other metastable states. Moreover, we conducted several mutant MD simulations to further investigate the mechanisms of how some drug-resistant mutations might affect the pre-hairpin formation, which in turn prevent the inhibitor recognition. Our findings provide deep structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of the pre-hairpin formation for gp41, which helps to guide future anti-HIV drug design.","[Lin, Mengna; Da, Lin-Tai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Da, LT (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",darlt@sjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,80,1,1,3,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,1549-960X,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.

Recently, a cryo-EM structure of the open channel state of hERG was reported, opening the door to in silico docking analyses and interpretation of hERG structure-activity relationships, with a view to avoiding blocking activity. Despite this, docking directly to this cryo-EM structure has been reported to yield binding modes that are unable to explain known mutagenesis data. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to sample a range of channel conformations and run ensemble docking campaigns at the known hERG binding site below the selectivity filter, composed of the central cavity and the four deep hydrophobic pockets. We identify a hERG conformational state allowing discrimination of blockers vs nonblockers from docking; furthermore, the binding pocket agrees with mutagenesis data, and blocker binding modes fit the hERG blocker pharmacophore. We then use the same protocol to identify a binding pocket in the hERG channel pore for hERG activators, again agreeing with the reported mutagenesis.

In this work, we demonstrate how cyclin dependency has emerged in cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by reconstructing their closest experimentally characterized cyclin-independent ancestor, CMGI, using molecular dynamics simulations. Four hypotheses are formulated to describe why CDKs require an additional regulatory switch, i.e. cyclin binding to adopt an active state. Each hypothesis is tested using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of CDK2 and the ancestor. In both systems, the K33-E51 hydrogen bond and the alignment of regulatory-spine residues have similar stabilities. However, auto-inhibition due to a helical turn in the A-loop is observed to be less favorable in the ancestor. Unlike the ancestor, the aspartate of the DFG motif does not form a bidentate bond with a Mg2+ ion in CDK2. These results explain the experimental observation of cyclin independency of the ancestor. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for how evolution has added a new regulatory switch to CDKs to tightly regulate the signalling pathways. This approach is directly applicable to other proteins to study the emergence of different types of regulatory mechanisms.","[Shamsi, Zahra; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","NSF Early Career AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 18-45606]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois","D.

As a key antigen that can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies, gp120 has been a focus for extensive studies with efforts to understand its structural properties and conformational dynamics upon receptor binding. An atomistic-level revelation of gp120 opening dynamics activated by CD4, however, is still unknown. Here, by constructing a Markov State Model (MSM) based on hundreds of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with an aggregated simulation time of similar to 20 microseconds (mu s), we identify the key metastable states of gp120 during its opening dynamics upon CD4 binding. The MSM provides a clear dynamic model whereby the identified metastable states coexist and can reach an equilibrium. More importantly, a hydrophobic core flanked by variable loops (V1V2 and V3) and the beta 20/21 region plays an essential role in triggering the gp120 opening. Any destabilizing effects introduced into the hydrophobic core, therefore, can be expected to promote transition of gp120 to an open state. Moreover, the variable loops demonstrate high flexibilities in fully open gp120. In particular, the V3 region is capable of exploring both closed and open conformations, even with the V1/V2 loops largely adopting an open form. In addition, the bridging sheet formation in gp120 is likely induced by the incoming co-receptor/antibody recognitions, since the V1/V2 structure is highly heterogeneous so that the bridging-sheet formed conformation is not the most populated state. Our studies provide deep insights into the dynamic features of gp120 and its molecular recognitions to the broadly neutralizing antibodies, which guides future attempts to design more effective gp120 immunogens.","[Da, Lin-Tai; Lin, Mengna] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Key Lab Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Da, LT (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Key Lab Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",darlt@sjtu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21703139],"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 21703139).

To obtain a broader view of dynamics, typically one needs to launch many such simulations, obtaining many trajectories. A summarization of the equilibrium dynamics requires integrating the information in the various trajectories, and Markov State Models (MSM) are increasingly being used for this task. At its core, the task involves organizing the structures accessed in simulation into structural states, and then constructing a transition probability matrix revealing the transitions between states. While now considered a mature technology and widely used to summarize equilibrium dynamics, the underlying computational process in the construction of an MSM ignores energetics even though the transition of a molecule between two nearby structures in an MD trajectory is governed by the corresponding energies. In this paper, we connect theory with simulation and analysis of equilibrium dynamics. A molecule navigates the energy landscape underlying the structure space. The structural states that are identified via off-the-shelf clustering algorithms need to be connected to thermody-namically-stable and semi-stable (macro)states among which transitions can then be quantified. Leveraging recent developments in the analysis of energy landscapes that identify basins in the landscape, we evaluate the hypothesis that basins, directly tied to stable and semi-stable states, lead to better models of dynamics. Our analysis indicates that basins lead to MSMs of better quality and thus can be useful to further advance this widely-used technology for summarization of molecular equilibrium dynamics.","[Kabir, Kazi Lutful; Akhter, Nasrin] George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Bioengn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Shehu, A (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Bioengn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",kkabir@gmu.edu; nakhter3@gmu.edu; amarda@gmu.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1440581, 1821154]; Jeffress Memorial Trust Award","This work is supported in part by the NSF Grant Nos. 1440581 and 1821154, and a Jeffress Memorial Trust Award.

Molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement methods have shown consistent improvement of protein models. There had been progress in the extent of refinement for a few years since the idea of ensemble averaging of sampled conformations emerged. There was little progress in CASP12 because conformational sampling was not sufficiently diverse due to harmonic restraints. During CASP13, a new refinement method was tested that achieved significant improvements over CASP12. The new method intended to address previous bottlenecks in the refinement problem by introducing new features. Flat-bottom harmonic restraints replaced harmonic restraints, sampling was performed iteratively, and a new scoring function and selection criteria were used. The new protocol expanded conformational sampling at reduced computational costs. In addition to overall improvements, some models were refined significantly to near-experimental accuracy.","[Heo, Lim; Arbour, Collin F.; Feig, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 603 Wilson Rd,Room 218 BCH, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Feig, M (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 603 Wilson Rd,Room 218 BCH, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mfeiglab@gmail.com,,,"NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R35 GM126948, R01 GM084953] Funding Source: Medline; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R35GM126948, R35GM126948, R35GM126948, R01GM084953, R35GM126948, R01GM084953] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",,,59,6,6,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-3585,1097-0134,,PROTEINS,Proteins,DEC,2019,87,12,,,SI,,1263,1275,,10.1002/prot.25759,,,13,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,JL6SD,WOS:000495659100021,31197841,Bronze,,,2020-11-19,

An atomic-level understanding of the structural dynamics of one critical catalytic loop in ppGalNAc-Ts from an open to a closed state upon substrate binding, however, is still elusive. Here, by constructing a Markov state model based on extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an aggregated simulation time of similar to 20 mu s, we reveal, at atomistic resolution, the key metastable states of the catalytic loop in ppGalNAc-T2 during its closing/opening dynamics after donor substrate (UDP-GalNAc) binding. The overall catalytic-loop closing motion is estimated to take place at a timescale of similar to tens of mu s, with the rate-limiting transition caused by some critical structural rearrangements within the catalytic loop region, coupled with the desolvation process. We find that the presence of UDP-GalNAc facilitates the formation of a stable interaction network with several nonloop residues (i.e., L204, V330, H145, and W331), which in turn promotes the loop closing. Moreover, the functional roles of several critical active-site residues were further evaluated through combining site-directed mutagenesis, high-performance liquid chromatography, MS/MS, and mutant MD simulations. It is intriguing to observe that the UDP-GalNAc binding and the following catalysis can tolerate all the tested loop-residue substitutions, some can even profoundly enhance the enzyme efficacy (i.e., H365A and F377A). More importantly, the catalytic loop is found to play a decisive role in regulating the glycosylation-site preferences. Our work provides the structural basis for the key regulatory factors that dictate the substrate loading and following catalysis during mucin-type O-glycosylation.","[Tian, Jiaqi; Liu, Feng; Xu, Zhijue; Shi, Jingjing; Liang, Tao; Zhang, Yan; Da, Lin-Tai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Zhang, Y; Da, LT (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",yanzhang2006@sjtu.edu.cn; darlt@sjtu.edu.cn,"Yang, Fang/AAF-3024-2019",,"National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31570796, 31770850]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21703139]","Y.Z. acknowledges the funding support of National Natural Science Foundation (grants 31570796 and 31770850).

First and the most important, the whole work is extremely simplified into two steps, one is the fast sampling procedure and the other is the trajectory analysis procedure. Second, it contains several powerful sampling methods for the simulation on graphics process unit, including our previous mixing replica exchange molecular dynamics method. The method combines the advantages of the biased and unbiased simulations. Finally, it extracts the dominant transition pathways automatically from the folding network by Markov state model.

Numerically, we illustrate cases where TAEs can and cannot correctly identify the leading slowest mode in two example systems: a 2D Washington beltway potential and the alanine dipeptide molecule in explicit water.

It reveals that the dual phosphorylation does not change overall size and secondary structure element fraction, while a change in the distribution of hydrogen bonds induces slightly more pre-existing bound helical conformations. MSM analysis indicates that the dual phosphorylation accelerates conformation exchange between disordered and order-like states in target-binding region. It suggests that p53 TAD2 after phosphorylation would be more apt to bind to both the human p62 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the yeast tfb1 PH domain through different binding mechanism, where experimentally it exhibits an extended and alpha-helix conformation, respectively, with increased binding strength in both complexes. Our study implies except binding interface, both conformation ensemble and kinetics should be considered for the effects of phosphorylation on IDPs.","[Zhao, Likun; Ouyang, Yanhua; Li, Qian; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,"; Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhao, Likun/0000-0003-3817-2329; Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21633001, 31870718]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China [Nos. 21633001, 31870718].",,69,1,1,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0739-1102,1538-0254,,J BIOMOL STRUCT DYN,J.

It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.","[Chen, Wei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sidky, Hythem; Ferguson, Andrew L.] Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Engn, 5640 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Ferguson, AL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Engn, 5640 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",andrewferguson@uchicago.edu,,"Ferguson, Andrew/0000-0002-8829-9726",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1841805]; Molecular Software Sciences Institute (MolSSI) Software Fellows program (NSF) [ACI-1547580],"This material is based on the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CHE-1841805.

Our method is centered around training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to identify optimal separatrices that delineate the regions of phase space that lead to different chemical reaction products. In contrast to the more common black box type machine learning methodologies for analyzing chemical simulation data, this SVM-based methodology allows for mechanistic insight to be gleaned from further analysis of the positioning of the phase space points used to train the SVM with respect to the separatrices. For example, a pair of phase space points that are in close proximity to each other but on opposite sides of a separatrix may be situated on opposite sides of a transition state, while phase space points occurring early in a simulation that are distant from a separatrix are likely to belong to trajectories that are highly biased toward the product state associated with the basin of attraction to which they belong. In addition to inferring mechanistic details about multiple-pathway chemical reactions, our method can also be used to increase reactive trajectory sampling efficiency in molecular simulations via rejection sampling, with trajectories leading to undesired product states being identified and terminated early in the simulation rather than being carried to completion.","[Grazioli, Gianmarc; Butts, Carter T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Calif Inst Telecommun & Informat Technol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Grazioli, Gianmarc; Roy, Saswata] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Butts, Carter T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Sociol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Butts, Carter T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Butts, Carter T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept EECS, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Butts, CT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Calif Inst Telecommun & Informat Technol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Butts, CT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Sociol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Butts, CT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Butts, CT (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept EECS, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",buttsc@uci.edu,,"Grazioli, Gianmarc/0000-0003-2559-5103",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1361425]; DOE Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0018352],"C.T.B. and G.G. were supported by NSF award DMS-1361425.

With the rapid development of experimental and computational methods, it is of great interest to integrate these approaches to illuminate the conformational landscapes of target proteins. SETD8 is a protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT), which functions in vivo via the methylation of histone and nonhistone targets. Utilizing covalent inhibitors and depleting native ligands to trap hidden conformational states, we obtained diverse X-ray structures of SETD8. These structures were used to seed distributed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that generated a total of six milliseconds of trajectory data. Markov state models, built via an automated machine learning approach and corroborated experimentally, reveal how slow conformational motions and conformational states are relevant to catalysis. These findings provide molecular insight on enzymatic catalysis and allosteric mechanisms of a PKMT via its detailed conformational landscape.","[Chen, Shi; Wiewiora, Rafal P.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Triinst PhD Program Chem Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Chen, Shi; Wang, Junyi; Blum, Gil; Pittella-Silva, Fabio; Luo, Minkui] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Chem Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Wiewiora, Rafal P.; Beauchamp, Kyle A.; Chodera, John D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat & Syst Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Meng, Fanwang; Fan, Shijie; Jiang, Hualiang; Chen, Kaixian; Luo, Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Mt Sinai Ctr Therapeut Discovery, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Oncol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Tisch Canc Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yu, Wenyu; Tempel, Wolfram; Brown, Peter J.] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Qian, Kun; Hu, Hao; Zheng, Yujun George] Univ Georgia, Dept Pharmaceut & Biomed Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Zou, Hua; Skene, Robert J.] Takeda Calif, Sci Ctr Dr, San Diego, CA USA; [Fan, Shijie; Jiang, Hualiang; Chen, Kaixian; Luo, Cheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Minkui] Cornell Univ, Program Pharmacol, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA","Luo, MK (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Chem Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Chodera, JD (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat & Syst Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Luo, C (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Luo, C (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Luo, MK (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Program Pharmacol, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",cluo@simm.ac.cn; john.chodera@choderalab.org; luom@mskcc.org,"Chen, Shi/AAE-9474-2020; Meng, Fanwang/K-4079-2019; Hu, Hao/AAJ-8523-2020","Chen, Shi/0000-0002-5860-2616; Meng, Fanwang/0000-0003-2886-7012; Hu, Hao/0000-0003-1365-0267; Qian, Kun/0000-0003-1132-2374; Brown, Peter/0000-0002-8454-0367; Chodera, John/0000-0003-0542-119X","UNC Eshelman Institute for Innovation; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [19XD1404700, 18431907100]; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Novartis Pharma; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R35GM131858, R01GM120570, R01GM126154, R01GM121505, R01GM122749, R01GM096056]; MerckMerck & Company; Janssen PharmaceuticalsJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81625022, 21820202008, 81430084, 91853205]; National Science & Technology Major Project of China [2018ZX09711002]; Mr. William H.

Often, these proteins are embedded within a membrane, which creates particular experimental challenges to surmount. This has resulted in computational methods providing a valuable complementary tool for some time now, especially in the development of working models at atomic resolution. Indeed, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are now routinely applied to new structures, either as part of the initial analysis or as part of an automated pipeline. Such simulations have proven extremely useful in terms of characterizing the inherent underlying conformational dynamics or providing insight into the interactions with the surrounding lipid molecules. However, MD simulations are capable of providing much more sophisticated information, including fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic properties of transitions between states and a description of how those transitions are influenced by the presence of ligands. There is a very large array of advanced simulation methods that can provide this information, but in this short review we limit ourselves to some selected examples of techniques that have given particular insight into proteins associated with molecular neurobiology. In this review, we highlight the use of i) Markov State Modelling to examine sodium dynamics in the dopamine transporter, ii) Metadynamics to explore neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated ion channel and iii) Steered MD to investigate conformational change in ionotropic glutamate receptors.","[Damgen, Marc A.; Biggin, Philip C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford, England","Biggin, PC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford, England.",Philip.biggin@bioch.ox.ac.uk,,"Damgen, Marc/0000-0002-8229-7906; Biggin, Philip/0000-0001-5100-8836",Oxford Wolfson Marriott Biochemistry Graduate Scholarship; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/M000435/1]; BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M006395/1],MAD was supported by an Oxford Wolfson Marriott Biochemistry Graduate Scholarship and by the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes.

Detailed, physics-based simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic-level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Simulations can now be used as computational assays of biological activity, for example, in predictions of drug resistance. Methodological and algorithmic developments, combined with advances in computational hardware, are transforming the scope and range of calculations. Different types of methods are required for different types of problem. Accurate methods and extensive simulations promise quantitative comparison with experiments across biochemistry. Atomistic simulations can now access experimentally relevant timescales for large systems, leading to a fertile interplay of experiment and theory and offering unprecedented opportunities for validating and developing models. Coarse-grained methods allow studies on larger length- and timescales, and theoretical developments are bringing electronic structure calculations into new regimes. Multiscale methods are another key focus for development, combining different levels of theory to increase accuracy, aiming to connect chemical and molecular changes to macroscopic observables. In this review, we outline biomolecular simulation methods and highlight examples of its application to investigate questions in biology.

These type of exercises could greatly benefit from an understanding of the structural impact that the inclusion of organometallic moieties may have on the biological host. To date though, our understanding of this phenomenon is highly partial. This lack of knowledge is one of the elements that condition that first-generation ArMs generally display relatively poor catalytic profiles. In this work, we approach this matter by assessing the dynamics and stability of a series of ArMs resulting from the inclusion, via different anchoring strategies, of a variety of organometallic cofactors into the Lactococcal multidrug resistance regulator (LmrR) protein. To this aim, we coupled standard force field-based techniques such as Protein-Ligand Docking and Molecular Dynamics simulations with a variety of trajectory convergence analyses, capable of assessing both the stability and flexibility of the different systems under study upon the binding of cofactors. Together with the experimental evidence obtained in other studies, we provide an overview on how these changes can affect the catalytic outcomes obtained from the different ArMs. Fundamentally, our results show that the convergence analysis used in this work can assess how the inclusion of synthetic metallic cofactors in proteins can condition different structural modulations of their host. Those conformational modifications are key to the success of the desired catalytic activity and their proper identification can be wisely used to improve the quality and the rate of success of the ArMs.","[Alonso-Cotchico, Lur; Rodriguez-Guerra Pedregal, Jaime; Lledos, Agusti; Marechal, Jean-Didier] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso-Cotchico, Lur] Univ Groningen, Stratingh Inst Chem, Groningen, Netherlands","Marechal, JD (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Quim, Barcelona, Spain.",jeandidier.marechal@uab.cat,"Lledos, Agusti/I-4936-2012; Marechal, Jean-Didier P/A-8936-2012; Chemistry, Stratingh Institute for/W-7694-2019","Lledos, Agusti/0000-0001-7909-422X; Marechal, Jean-Didier P/0000-0002-8344-9043; Rodriguez-Guerra Pedregal, Jaime/0000-0001-8974-1566",Spanish grant [CTQ2017-87889-P]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2017 SGR 1323]; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CM1306],All the authors are thankful for the support given by the Spanish grant CTQ2017-87889-P as well as the Generalitat de Catalunya grant 2017 SGR 1323.

Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that helps plants survive drought by mediating guard cell closure. Since the identification of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, the mechanism underlying ABA signaling has been intensely investigated. However, dynamic and energetic aspects of ABA-mediated activation of receptors and their downregulation by post-translational modifications remain elusive. Using molecular simulations, we establish complete ABA recognition pathways by two subtype receptors (PYL5 and PYL10) and a modified PYL5 receptor through tyrosine nitration. Energetic landscapes reveal that ABA binding is necessary but insufficient for full receptor activation, and ABA must surmount a large energy barrier to bind the receptors. The major barrier appears to be associated with substantial dewetting of both ABA and receptor during ABA binding. Finally, our results suggest that tyrosine nitration of ABA receptors alters the binding pocket, thereby preventing ABA perception and receptor activation.","[Shukla, Saurabh; Zhao, Chuankai; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Zhao, Chuankai/0000-0002-6879-6514; Shukla, Saurabh/0000-0002-7632-8163; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project - National Science Foundation [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research via the New Innovator Award in Food & Agriculture Research; 3M Corporate Fellowship3M; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois","The authors acknowledge the support from the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

These off-target interactions have major therapeutic consequences including undesired side effects, loss of bioavailability and emergence of resistance. Insulin is one of the prototypical protein targets of platinum drugs as it has been seen to be involved in bioavailability reduction and might also determine resistance in certain cancer lines. However, despite the interest in understanding the nature of the oxaliplatin-insulin adducts, no 3D models have been achieved so far. In this study, we apply our recent computational multiscale protocol optimized for bioinorganic interactions to provide structural insights into these systems. To do so, the initial structures are predicted by blind protein-metalloligand docking calculations optimized to account for a metal-containing species, and then refined using a Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) integrated protocol. The results are consistent with experimental information obtained from fragment analysis, and also provide novel structural information like conformational changes occurring upon binding and potential effects on the biological functions of the protein.

Adaptive sampling methods-in which one performs multiple rounds of simulation, with the initial conditions of each round based on the results of previous rounds-offer a promising potential solution to this problem. No comprehensive analysis of the performance gains from adaptive sampling is available for ligand binding, however, particularly for protein-ligand systems typical of those encountered in drug discovery. Moreover, most previous work presupposes knowledge of the ligand's bound pose. Here we outline existing methods for adaptive sampling of the ligand-binding process and introduce several improvements, with a focus on methods that do not require prior knowledge of the binding site or bound pose. We then evaluate these methods by comparing them to traditional, long MD simulations for realistic protein-ligand systems. We find that adaptive sampling simulations typically fail to reach the bound pose more efficiently than traditional MD. However, adaptive sampling identifies multiple potential binding sites more efficiently than traditional MD and also provides better characterization of binding pathways. We explain these results by showing that protein-ligand binding is an example of an exploration-exploitation dilemma. Existing adaptive sampling methods for ligand binding in the absence of a known bound pose vastly favor the broad exploration of protein-ligand space, sometimes failing to sufficiently exploit intermediate states as they are discovered. We suggest potential avenues for future research to address this shortcoming.","[Dror, Ron O.] Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Stanford Univ, Inst Computat & Math Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ron.dror@stanford.edu,,"Betz, Robin/0000-0001-6781-7101",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM127359]; NIH Biophysics Training Grant [GM008294]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE1656518]; NVIDIA Fellowship; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM127359] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM127359 (RO.D.), NIH Biophysics Training Grant GM008294 (R.M.B.), National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship award number DGE1656518 (RM.B.), and an NVIDIA Fellowship (RM.B.).",,48,8,8,0,6,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

While we now know a great deal about a helix folding dynamics, a key question that remains to be answered is where the productive helical nucleation event occurs. Statistically, a helical nucleus (or the first helical hydrogen-bond) can form anywhere within the peptide sequence in question; however, the one that leads to productive folding may only form at a preferred location. This consideration is based on the fact that the alpha-helical structure is inherently asymmetric, due to the specific alignment of the helical hydrogen bonds. While this hypothesis is plausible, validating it is challenging because there is not an experimental observable that can be used to directly pinpoint the location of the productive nucleation process. Therefore, in this study we combine several techniques, including peptide cross linking, laser-induced temperature-jump infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, to tackle this challenge. Taken together, our experimental and simulation results support an alpha-helix folding mechanism wherein the productive nucleus is formed at the N-terminus, which propagates toward the C-terminal end of the peptide to yield the folded structure.

Lignin chemical diversity complicates traditional structural studies, and so, relatively little experimental evidence exists for how lignin structure exists in aqueous solution or how lignin polymers respond to changes in their chemical environment. Molecular modeling can address these concerns; however, prior computational structural lignin models typically did not capture lignin heterogeneity, as only a few polymers were considered. LigninBuilder creates a framework for building structural libraries for lignin from existing topological libraries, permitting significantly greater diversity of lignin structures to be sampled at atomic detail. As a demonstration of its capabilities, LigninBuilder was applied to three libraries of lignin from hardwood, softwood, and grass, and the resulting polymer structures were simulated in an aqueous environment. The lignins adopted compact globular structures, as would be expected for polymers in poor solvents. The differences between the libraries were largest when quantifying the packing of nonadjacent aromatic residues, with greater branching within the polymer resulting in poorer aromatic packing. Individual lignin polymers were also found to undergo rapid conformational changes, with the dwell time within a state growing as the square of the molecular weight. This first application of LigninBuilder demonstrates the potential for atomic-level insight into lignin interactions. LigninBuilder is distributed as a plugin to the visualization software VMD, lowering the barrier for modeling lignin structure in diverse environments.","[Vermaas, Josh V.; Crowley, Michael F.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Dellon, Lauren D.; Broadbelt, Linda J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Beckham, Gregg T.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Natl Bioenergy Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA","Crowley, MF (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.; Beckham, GT (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Natl Bioenergy Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",gregg.beckham@nrel.gov; michael.crowley@nrel.gov,"Broadbelt, Linda/B-7640-2009; Vermaas, Josh/X-7032-2019","Vermaas, Josh/0000-0003-3139-6469","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08G028308]; NREL Director's Fellowship - Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1435228]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Bioenergy Technology OfficeUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Center for Bioenergy Innovation, U.S. DOE Bioenergy Research Center - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and located at the National Renewable Energy LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","The authors thank Noah Trebesch for a fruitful discussion that guided the design of the algorithm for automated ring piercing amelioration, as well as Loukas Petridis and Nicholas Rorrer for discussions relating to polymer theory.

We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A'/A and previously overlooked E/F loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.","[Zhou, Hongyu; Dong, Zheng; Zoltowski, Brian D.; Tao, Peng] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Sci Computat, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Dallas, TX 75205 USA; [Verkhivker, Gennady] Chapman Univ, Schmid Coll Sci & Technol, Grad Program Computat & Data Sci, Orange, CA USA; [Verkhivker, Gennady] Chapman Univ, Sch Pharm, Irvine, CA USA","Tao, P (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Sci Computat, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Dallas, TX 75205 USA.",ptao@smu.edu,"Verkhivker, Gennady/V-9404-2018; Tao, Peng/H-4925-2014","Verkhivker, Gennady/0000-0002-4507-4471; Zoltowski, Brian/0000-0001-6749-0743; Tao, Peng/0000-0002-2488-0239","NIH R15 Award [GM122013]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2R15GM109282]; Southern Methodist University Dissertation Fellowship; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R15GM109282, R15GM122013] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We gratefully acknowledge funding sources, including NIH R15 Award (GM122013) to PT, NIH 2R15GM109282 to BDZ, and Southern Methodist University Dissertation Fellowship to HZ.

While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called OpenPathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant (RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.","[Swenson, David W.

Given the enormity of conformational space, there has been ongoing interest in identifying a small number of states that capture the essential features of a protein. Generally, this is achieved by making assumptions about the properties of relevant features-for example, that the most important features are those that change slowly. An alternative strategy is to keep as many degrees of freedom as possible and subsequently learn from the model which of the features are most important. In these larger models, however, traditional approaches quickly become computationally intractable. In this paper, we present enspara, a library for working with MSMs that provides several novel algorithms and specialized data structures that dramatically improve the scalability of traditional MSM methods. This includes ragged arrays for minimizing memory requirements, message passing interface-parallelized implementations of compute-intensive operations, and a flexible framework for model construction and analysis.

This polymorphism occurs in short consensus repeat (SCR) 7 of FH and results in decreased binding affinity of SCR6-8 for heparin. As FH is responsible for regulating the complement system, decreased affinity for heparin results in decreased regulation on surfaces of self. To understand the involvement of the Y402H polymorphism in AMD, we leverage methods from bioinformatics and computational biophysics to quantify structural and dynamical differences between SCR7 isoforms that contribute to decreased pattern recognition in SCR7(H402). Our data from molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations suggest a revised mechanism for decreased heparin binding. In this model, transient contacts not observed in structures for SCR7 are predicted to occur in molecular dynamics simulations between coevolved residues Y402 and 1412, stabilizing SCR7(Y402) in a conformation that promotes association with heparin. H402 in the risk isoform is less likely to form a contact with 1412 and samples a larger conformational space than Y402. We observe energy minima for sidechains of Y402 and R404 from SCR7(Y402) that are predicted to associate with heparin at a rate constant faster than energy minima for sidechains of H402 and R404 from SCR7(H402). As both carbohydrate density and degree of sulfation decrease with age in Bruch's membrane of the macula, the decreased heparin recognition of SCR7(H402) may contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.","[Harrison, Reed E.

PAH senses elevated Phe concentrations by transient allosteric Phe binding to a protein-protein interface between ACT domains of different subunits in a PAH tetramer. This interface is present in an activated PAH (A-PAH) tetramer and absent in a resting-state PAH (RS-PAH) tetramer. To investigate this allosteric sensing mechanism, here we used the GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation suite on the Folding@home computing platform to perform extensive molecular simulations and Markov state model (MSM) analysis of Phe binding to ACT domain dimers. These simulations strongly implicated a conformational selection mechanism for Phe association with ACT domain dimers and revealed protein motions that act as a gating mechanism for Phe binding. The MSMs also illuminate a highly mobile hairpin loop, consistent with experimental findings also presented here that the PAH variant L72W does not shift the PAH structural equilibrium toward the activated state. Finally, simulations of ACT domain monomers are presented, in which spontaneous transitions between resting-state and activated conformations are observed, also consistent with a mechanism of conformational selection. These mechanistic details provide detailed insight into the regulation of PAH activation and provide testable hypotheses for the development of new allosteric effectors to correct structural and functional defects in PAH.","[Ge, Yunhui; Voelz, Vincent A.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Borne, Elias; Stewart, Shannon; Hansen, Michael R.; Arturo, Emilia C.; Jaffe, Eileen

Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. In this study, we demonstrate how small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) information can be incorporated in Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased MD simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. Our results show that using SAXS data combined with additional information, such as thermodynamics and distance restraints, we are able to distinguish otherwise degenerate structures due to the inherent ambiguity of SAXS pattern. We further demonstrate that adaptive sampling guided by SAXS and hybrid information can significantly reduce the computation time required to discover target structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach in predicting near-native structures of proteins and complexes. Other low-resolution experimental information can be incorporated in a similar manner to collectively enhance unbiased sampling and improve the accuracy of structure prediction from simulation.","[Zhao, Chuankai; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar.shukla@shuklagroup.org,,"Zhao, Chuankai/0000-0002-6879-6514; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project - National Science Foundation [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research via the New Innovator Award in Food & Agriculture Research; 3M Corporate Fellowship from the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois","We acknowledge the support from the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

These experiments measure the relaxation of a particular labeled set of residue pairs, and the choice of residue pairs requires careful thought. As a result, experimentalists must pick residue pairs from a large pool of possibilities. In the current work, we show that molecular simulation datasets of protein dynamics can be used to systematically select an optimal set of residue positions to place probes for conducting spectroscopic experiments. The method described in this work, called Optimal Probes, can be used to rank trial sets of residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Optimal probes ensures two conditions: residue pairs capture the slow dynamics of the protein and their dynamics is not correlated for maximum information gain to score each trial set. Eventually, the highest scored set can be used for biophysical experiments to study the kinetics of the protein. The scoring methodology is based on kinetic network models of protein dynamics and a variational principle for molecular kinetics to optimize the hyperparameters used for the model. We also discuss that the scoring strategy used by Optimal Probes is the best possible way to ensure the ideal choice of residue pairs for experiments. We predict the best experimental probe positions for proteins lambda-repressor, beta(2) adrenergic receptor, and villin headpiece domain. These proteins have been well-studied and allow for a rigorous comparison of Optimal Probes predictions with already available experiments. Additionally, we also illustrate that our method can be used to predict the best choice for experiments by including any previous experiment choices available from other studies on the same protein. We consistently find that the best choice cannot be based on intuition or structural information such as distance difference between few known stable structures of the protein. Therefore, we show that incorporating protein dynamics could be used to maximize the information gain from experiments.","[Mittal, Shriyaa; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Mittal, Shriyaa/0000-0003-3490-1969; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; CSE Fellows Program, Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL","The authors thank DE Shaw Research (DESRES), NY, and Pande Lab at Stanford University for MD simulation datasets.

Namely, how do alternative sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence predictions generated from the data? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: (1) a single long simulation, (2) many short simulations run in parallel, (3) adaptive sampling, and (4) our recently developed goal-oriented sampling algorithm, FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering select states on simple landscapes, where we uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize the probability of discovering particular states and transition pathways for each of the four methods. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover each target state with the highest probability, while traversing realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the potential pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate. We refer to this pathology as pathway tunneling. To protect against this phenomenon when using adaptive-sampling and FAST simulations, we introduce the FAST-string method. This method enhances sampling along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare the performance of a variety of MSM estimators in describing accurate thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend simply normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding small pseudocounts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate whether our insights from simple landscapes hold for all atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the lambda-repressor protein. Remarkably, we find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as a set of long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.","[Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Porter, Justin R.; Sun, Xianqiang; Silva, Roseane R.; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",bowman@biochem.wustl.edu,,"Porter, Justin/0000-0002-0340-951X","NSF CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [MCB-1552471]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM12400701]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was funded by NSF CAREER Award MCB-1552471 and NIH R01GM12400701.,,83,12,12,0,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

It is normally desired that suitable dimensionality reduction methods could clearly distinguish functionally important states with different conformations for the systems of interest. However, common dimensionality reduction methods for macromolecules simulations, including predefined order parameters and collective variables (CVs), principal component analysis (PCA), and time-structure based independent component analysis (t-ICA), only have limited success due to significant key structural information loss. Here, we introduced the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method as a dimensionality reduction method with minimum structural information loss widely used in bioinformatics for analyses of macromolecules, especially biomacromolecules simulations. It is demonstrated that both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models of the t-SNE method are superior to distinguish important functional states of a model allosteric protein system for free energy and mechanistic analysis. Projections of the model protein simulations onto 1D and 2D t-SNE surfaces provide both clear visual cues and quantitative information, which is not readily available using other methods, regarding the transition mechanism between two important functional states of this protein.","[Zhou, Hongyu; Wang, Feng; Tao, Peng] Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Ctr Sci Computat, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Tao, P (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, Ctr Drug Discovery Design & Delivery CD4, Ctr Sci Computat, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",ptao@smu.edu,"Tao, Peng/H-4925-2014; Wang, Feng/Q-6884-2017","Tao, Peng/0000-0002-2488-0239; Wang, Feng/0000-0001-7808-7538",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM122013]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R15GM122013] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [GM122013].

The construction of free energy profiles describing the full dynamical behavior along the phase transition path is challenging since it is not trivial to identify collective variables able to identify all metastable states along the reaction path. In this work, a systematic three-step protocol to uniquely identify the dominant order parameters for structural transformations in flexible metal-organic frameworks and subsequently construct accurate free energy profiles is presented. Methodologically, this protocol is rooted in the time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA), a well-established statistical modeling technique embedded in the Markov state model methodology and often employed to study protein folding, that allows for the identification of the slowest order parameters characterizing the structural transformation. To ensure an unbiased and systematic identification of these order parameters, the tICA decomposition is performed based on information from a prior replica exchange (RE) simulation, as this technique enhances the sampling along all degrees of freedom of the system simultaneously. From this simulation, the tICA procedure extracts the order parameters-often structural parameters-that characterize the slowest transformations in the material. Subsequently, these order parameters are adopted in traditional enhanced sampling methods such as umbrella sampling, thermodynamic integration, and variationally enhanced sampling to construct accurate free energy profiles capturing the flexibility in these nanoporous materials. In this work, the applicability of this tICA-RE protocol is demonstrated by determining the slowest order parameters in both MIL-53(Al) and CAU-13, which exhibit a strongly different type of flexibility. The obtained free energy profiles as a function of this extracted order parameter are furthermore compared to the profiles obtained when adopting less-suited collective variables, indicating the importance of systematically selecting the relevant order parameters to construct accurate free energy profiles for flexible metal-organic frameworks, which is in correspondence with experimental findings. The method succeeds in mapping the full free energy surface in terms of appropriate collective variables for MOFs exhibiting linker flexibility. For CAU-13, we show the decreased stability of the closed pore phase by systematically adding adsorbed xylene molecules in the framework.","[Demuynck, Ruben; Wieme, Jelle; Rogge, Sven M.

Many enhanced sampling methods have been developed with the goal of predicting ligand binding rates (k(on)) and/or ligand unbinding rates (k(off)) through explicit simulation of ligand binding pathways, and these methods work by very different mechanisms. Although there is not yet a blind challenge for ligand binding kinetics, here we take advantage of experimental measurements and rigorously computed benchmarks to compare estimates of K-D calculated as the ratio of two rates: k(off)/k(on). These rates were determined using a new enhanced sampling method based on the weighted ensemble framework that we call REVO: Reweighting of Ensembles by Variance Optimization. This is a further development of the WExplore enhanced sampling method, in which trajectory cloning and merging steps are guided not by the definition of sampling regions, but by maximizing trajectory variance. Here we obtain estimates of k(on) and k(off) that are consistent across multiple simulations, with an average log10-scale standard deviation of 0.28 for on-rates and 0.56 for off-rates, which is well within an order of magnitude and far better than previously observed for previous applications of the WExplore algorithm. Our rank ordering of the three host-guest pairs agrees with the reference calculations, however our predicted Delta G values were systematically lower than the reference by an average of 4.2 kcal/mol. Using tree network visualizations of the trajectories in the REVO algorithm, and conformation space networks for each system, we analyze the results of our sampling, and hypothesize sources of discrepancy between our K-D values and the reference. We also motivate the direct inclusion of k(on) and k(off) challenges in future iterations of SAMPL, to further develop the field of ligand binding kinetics prediction and modeling.","[Dixon, Tom; Lotz, Samuel D.; Dickson, Alex] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dixon, Tom; Dickson, Alex] Michigan State Univ, Dept Computat Math Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Dickson, A (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Dickson, A (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Computat Math Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",alexrd@msu.edu,,,,,,41,10,10,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-654X,1573-4951,,J COMPUT AID MOL DES,J.

However, high dimensionality and inherent complexities associated with such biochemical systems render the identification of an optimal CV a challenging task, which in turn precludes the elucidation of an underlying conformational landscape in sufficient details. In this context, a relevant model system is presented by a 16-residue) 6-hairpin of GB1 protein. Despite being the target of numerous theoretical and computational studies for understanding the protein folding, the set of CVs optimally characterizing the conformational landscape of the ) 6-hairpin of GB1 protein has remained elusive, resulting in a lack of consensus on its folding mechanism. Here we address this by proposing a pair of optimal CVs which can resolve the underlying free energy landscape of the GB1 hairpin quite efficiently. Expressed as a linear combination of a number of traditional CVs, the optimal CV for this system is derived by employing the recently introduced time-structured independent component analysis approach on a large number of independent unbiased simulations. By projecting the replica-exchange simulated trajectories along these pair of optimized CVs, the resulting free energy landscape of this system is able to resolve four distinct well-separated metastable states encompassing the extensive ensembles of folded, unfolded, and molten globule states. Importantly, the optimized CVs were found to be capable of automatically recovering a novel partial helical state of this protein, without needing to explicitly invoke helicity as a constituent CV. Furthermore, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of each constituent in the optimized CV provided key insights on the relative contributions of the constituent CVs in the overall free energy landscapes. Finally, the kinetic pathways connecting these metastable states, constructed using a Markov state model, provide an optimum description of the underlying folding mechanism of the peptide. Taken together, this work offers a quantitatively robust approach toward comprehensive mapping of the underlying folding landscape of a quintessential model system along its optimized CV.

To overcome this bottleneck, we present the REinforcement learning based Adaptive samPling (REAP) algorithm that aims to efficiently sample conformational space by learning the relative importance of each order parameter as it samples the landscape. To achieve this, the algorithm uses concepts from the field of reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which rewards sampling along important degrees of freedom and disregards others that do not facilitate exploration or exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of REAP by comparing the sampling to long continuous MD simulations and least-counts adaptive sampling on two model landscapes (L-shaped and circular) and realistic systems such as alanine dipeptide and Src kinase. In all four systems, the REAP algorithm consistently demonstrates its ability to explore conformational space faster than the other two methods when comparing the expected values of the landscape discovered for a given amount of time. The key advantage of REAP is on-the-fly estimation of the importance of collective variables, which makes it particularly useful for systems with limited structural information.","[Shamsi, Zahra; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cheng, Kevin J.; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign; National Academies of Arts, Sciences and Medicine","Authors acknowledge the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

Computational approaches can help analyze rare events that are difficult to study experimentally. However. analyzing the frequency and dynamics of rare events in computational models can also be challenging due to high computational resource demands, especially for high-fidelity stochastic computational models. To facilitate analysis of rare events in complex biological systems, we present a multifidelity analysis approach that uses medium-fidelity analysis (Monte Carlo simulations) and/or low-fidelity analysis (Markov chain models) to analyze high-fidelity stochastic model results. Medium-fidelity analysis can produce large numbers of possible rare event trajectories for a single high-fidelity model simulation. This allows prediction of both rare event dynamics and probability distributions at much lower frequencies than high-fidelity models. Low-fidelity analysis can calculate probability distributions for rare events over time for any frequency by updating the probabilities of the rare event state space after each discrete event of the high-fidelity model. To validate the approach. we apply multifidelity analysis to a high-fidelity model of tuberculosis disease. We validate the method against high-fidelity model results and illustrate the application of multifidelity analysis in predicting rare event trajectories, performing sensitivity analyses and extrapolating predictions to very low frequencies in complex systems. We believe that our approach will complement ongoing efforts to enable accurate prediction of rare event dynamics in high-fidelity computational models.","[Pienaar, Elsje] Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Pienaar, E (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Weldon Sch Biomed Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",epienaar@purdue.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U01HL131072, R01 HL 110811]; Office of Science of the US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) by National Science Foundation [MCB140228]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author thanks the Kirschner and Linderman Labs at the University of Michigan for use of GranSim data supported by the following NIH grants: U01HL131072 and R01 HL 110811.

However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.","[Tse, Margaret J.; Chu, Brian K.; Gallivan, Cameron P.; Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",elread@uci.edu,,"Read, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9186-284X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS 1715455],"The research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation [https://www.nsf.gov DMS 1715455 to ELR].

As an intrinsically global effect of protein dynamics, it is difficult to associate protein allostery with individual residues, hindering effective selection of key residues for mutagenesis studies. The machine learning models including decision tree (DT) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were applied to develop classification model for a cell signaling allosteric protein with two states showing extremely similar tertiary structures in both crystallographic structures and molecular dynamics simulations. Both DT and ANN models were developed with 75% and 80% of predicting accuracy, respectively. Good agreement between machine learning models and previous experimental as well as computational studies of the same protein validates this approach as an alternative way to analyze protein dynamics simulations and allostery. In addition, the difference of distributions of key features in two allosteric states also underlies the population shift hypothesis of dynamics-driven allostery model.

Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation barrier for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects.

TDG is shown to play essential roles in maintaining genome integrity and correctly programming epigenetic modifications through DNA demethylation. After locating the lesions, TDG employs a base-flipping strategy to recognize the damaged nucleobases, whereby the interrogated nt is extruded from the DNA helical stack and binds into the TDG active site. The dynamic mechanism of the base-flipping process at an atomistic resolution, however, remains elusive. Here, we employ the Markov State Model (MSM) constructed from extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the complete base-flipping process for a G.T mispair at a tens of microsecond timescale. Our studies identify critical intermediates of the mispaired dT during its extrusion process and reveal the key TDG residues involved in the inter-state transitions. Notably, we find an active role of TDG in promoting the intrahelical nt eversion, sculpturing the DNA backbone, and penetrating into the DNA minor groove. Three additional TDG substrates, namely dU, 5fC, and 5caC, are further tested to evaluate the substituent effects of various chemical modifications of the pyrimidine ring on base-flipping dynamics.","[Da, Lin-Tai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jin] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Da, LT (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Ctr Syst Biomed, Minist Educ, Key Lab Syst Biomed, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",darlt@sjtu.edu.cn,"Yu, Jin/X-6895-2019","Yu, Jin/0000-0001-8224-1374","Pujiang Talent Project of Shanghai [17PJ1403600]; Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University [WF220441503]; NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11775016, 11635002]","Pujiang Talent Project of Shanghai [17PJ1403600 to L.T.D.]; Startup funding from Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University [WF220441503]; NSFC [11775016, 11635002 to J.Y.].

While recent work from our group and others has demonstrated the utility of time-lagged covariate models to study such systems, linearity assumptions can limit the compression of inherently nonlinear dynamics into just a few characteristic components. Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics.

By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suitable but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B reversible arrow C).

Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type.

So far, geometric order parameters, such as the root mean square deviation, fraction of native amino acid contacts, and collective coordinates that best characterize rare or large conformational transitions, have been prevailing in protein folding studies. Here, we show that the solvent-averaged effective energy, which is a thermodynamic quantity but unambiguously defined for individual protein conformations, serves as a good order parameter of protein folding. This is illustrated through the application to the folding-unfolding simulation trajectory of villin headpiece subdomain. We rationalize the suitability of the effective energy as an order parameter by the funneledness of the underlying protein free energy landscape. We also demonstrate that an improved conformational space discretization is achieved by incorporating the effective energy. The most distinctive feature of this thermodynamic order parameter is that it works in pointing to near-native folded structures even when the knowledge of the native structure is lacking, and the use of the effective energy will also find applications in combination with methods of protein structure prediction.","[Chong, Song-Ho; Ham, Sihyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341, 2017R1A2B3010053]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Nos NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341 and 2017R1A2B3010053).

The former provide time series data, such as donor-acceptor distances, whereas the latter give atomistic information, although this information is often biased by model parameters. Here, we devise a machine-learning method to combine the complementary information from the two approaches and construct a consistent model of conformational dynamics. It is applied to the folding dynamics of the forminbinding protein WW domain. MD simulations over 400 mu s led to an initial Markov state model (MSM), which was then refined using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data through hidden Markov modeling. The refined or data-assimilated MSM reproduces the FRET data and features hairpin one in the transition-state ensemble, consistent with mutation experiments. The folding pathway in the data-assimilated MSM suggests interplay between hydrophobic contacts and turn formation.

We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning about a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation. This method shows promise for its ability to rapidly sample related systems using a single transferable collective variable, enabling us to probe the effects of variation in increasingly large systems of biophysical interest.","[Sultan, Mohammad M.; Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,,NSF GFRP; National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [ACI-1429830];  [NSF-MCB-0954714]; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1429830] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"M.M.S. acknowledges support from NSF-MCB-0954714.

Although linear algebra provides an exact computational solution of secondary structure folding kinetics with respect to the Turner energy model for tiny (20 nt) RNA sequences, the folding kinetics for larger sequences can only be approximated by binning structures into macrostates in a coarse-grained model, or by repeatedly simulating secondary structure folding with either the Monte Carlo algorithm or the Gillespie algorithm. Here we investigate the relation between the Monte Carlo algorithm and the Gillespie algorithm. We prove that asymptotically, the expected time for a K-step trajectory of the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to times that of the Gillespie algorithm, where denotes the Boltzmann expected network degree. If the network is regular (i.e. every node has the same degree), then the mean first passage time (MFPT) computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm is equal to MFPT computed by the Gillespie algorithm multiplied by ; however, this is not true for non-regular networks. In particular, RNA secondary structure folding kinetics, as computed by the Monte Carlo algorithm, is not equal to the folding kinetics, as computed by the Gillespie algorithm, although the mean first passage times are roughly correlated.

It has become evident, however, that structural differences such as the long N-and C-termini of the eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporters are involved in an expanded set of functional properties to the eukaryotic transporters. These functional properties are not shared by the bacterial homologs, which lack the structural elements that appeared later in evolution. However, mechanistic insights into some of the measured functional properties of the eukaryotic transporters that have been suggested to involve these structural elements are sparse or merely descriptive. Results: To learn how the structural elements added in evolution enable mechanisms of the eukaryotic transporters in ways not shared with their bacterial LeuT-like homologs, we focused on the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) as a prototype. We present the results of a study employing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and comparative Markov state model analysis of experimentally determined properties of the wild-type and mutant hDAT constructs. These offer a quantitative outline of mechanisms in which a rich spectrum of interactions of the hDAT N-terminus and C-terminus contribute to the regulation of transporter function (e.g., by phosphorylation) and/or to entirely new phenotypes (e.g., reverse uptake (efflux)) that were added in evolution. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with the proposal that the size of eukaryotic neurotransmitter transporter termini increased during evolution to enable more functions (e.g., efflux) not shared with the bacterial homologs. The mechanistic explanations for the experimental findings about the modulation of function in DAT, the serotonin transporter, and other eukaryotic transporters reveal separate roles for the distal and proximal segments of the much larger N-terminus in eukaryotic transporters compared to the bacterial ones. The involvement of the proximal and distal segments-such as the role of the proximal segment in sustaining transport in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-depleted membranes and of the distal segment in modulating efflux-may represent an evolutionary adaptation required for the function of eukaryotic transporters expressed in various cell types of the same organism that differ in the lipid composition and protein complement of their membrane environment.","[Razavi, Asghar M.; Khelashvili, George; Weinstein, Harel] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Khelashvili, George; Weinstein, Harel] Cornell Univ, Inst Computat Biomed, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA","Weinstein, H (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Weinstein, H (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Inst Computat Biomed, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10065 USA.",haw2002@med.cornell.edu,"WEINSTEIN, HAREL/O-8245-2019","WEINSTEIN, HAREL/0000-0003-3473-9818","National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P01 DA012408, R01 DA041510, U54 GM087519]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, R01DA041510, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, R01DA041510, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, R01DA041510, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, R01DA041510, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408, P01DA012408] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants P01 DA012408, R01 DA041510, and in part U54 GM087519.",,82,17,17,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1741-7007,,,BMC BIOL,BMC Biol.,MAR 14,2018,16,,,,,,,,31,10.1186/s12915-018-0495-6,,,14,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,FZ6FU,WOS:000427694000001,29540172,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

It might be subject to time-varying forcing; or be in a transient phase on its way towards equilibrium; it might even be in equilibrium without us noticing it, due to insufficient observations; and it even might be a system failing to admit an equilibrium distribution at all. We review some of the approaches that model the effective statistical behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and show that both cases can be considered under the unified framework of optimal low-rank approximation of so-called transfer operators. Particular attention is given to the connection between these methods, Markov state models, and the concept of metastability, further to the estimation of such reduced order models from finite simulation data. All these topics bear an important role in, e.g., molecular dynamics, where Markov state models are often and successfully utilized, and which is the main motivating application in this paper.

This perspective offers an overview of the MSM field to date, presented for a general audience as a timeline of key developments in the field. We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for MSMs in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving MSM building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of MSM analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein-protein association.

In these systems, at the temperature used, the peptide can be folded or unfolded and bound or unbound to crowder molecules. Four or five major free-energy minima can be identified. To estimate the dominant MC relaxation times of the peptide, we build MSMs using a range of different time resolutions or lag times. We show that stable relaxation-time estimates can be obtained from the MSM eigenfunctions through fits to autocorrelation data. The eigenfunctions remain sufficiently accurate to permit stable relaxation-time estimation down to small lag times, at which point simple estimates based on the corresponding eigenvalues have large systematic uncertainties. The presence of the crowders has a stabilizing effect on the peptide, especially with BPTI crowders, which can be attributed to a reduced unfolding rate k(u), while the folding rate k(f) is left largely unchanged.

We report that, in the process of scrambling, lipid head groups traverse a dynamically revealed hydrophilic pathway in the region between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of the protein while their hydrophobic tails remain in the bilayer environment. We present quantitative kinetic models of the translocation process based on Markov State Model analysis.

The coarse graining of MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for the coarse-graining of MSMs into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.","[Husic, Brooke E.; McKiernan, Keri A.; Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.; Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,"Husic, Brooke/0000-0002-8020-3750",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH R01-GM62868]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowhip Program,We acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH R01-GM62868).

After catalysis, the release of excised base is a requisite step to terminate the catalytic cycle and liberate the TDG for the following enzymatic reactions. However, an atomistic-level understanding of the dynamics of the product release process in TDG remains unknown. Here, by employing molecular dynamics simulations combined with the Markov State Model, we reveal the dynamics of the thymine release after the excision at microseconds timescale and all-atom resolution. We identify several key metastable states of the thymine and its dominant releasing pathway. Notably, after replacing the TDG residue Gly142 with tyrosine, the thymine release is delayed compared to the wild-type (wt) TDG, as supported by our potential of mean force (PMF) calculations. These findings warrant further experimental tests to potentially trap the excised base in the active site of TDG after the catalysis, which had been unsuccessful by previous attempts.

Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension- reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.","[Mardt, Andreas; Pasquali, Luca; Wu, Hao; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Transregio 186/A12, SFB 1114/A4, 825/4-1, 2518]; European Research CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERC StG 307494]","We are grateful to Cecilia Clementi, Robert T.

However, due to the low resolution of SAXS data, high-resolution data obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR and computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are complementary to SAXS data for understanding protein functions based on their structures at atomic resolution. Because MD simulations provide a physicochemically proper structural ensemble for flexible proteins in solution and a precise description of solvent effects, the hybrid analysis of SAXS and MD simulations is a promising method to estimate reasonable solution structures and structural ensembles in solution. Here, we review typical and useful in silico methods for modeling three dimensional protein structures, calculating theoretical SAXS profiles, and analyzing ensemble structures consistent with experimental SAXS profiles. We also review two examples of the hybrid analysis, termed MD-SAXS method in which MD simulations are carried out without any knowledge of experimental SAXS data, and the experimental SAXS data are used only to assess the consistency of the solution model from MD simulations with those observed in experiments. One example is an investigation of the intrinsic dynamics of EcoO109I using the computational method to obtain a theoretical profile from the trajectory of an MD simulation. The other example is a structural investigation of the vitamin D receptor ligand-binding domain using snapshots generated by MD simulations and assessment of the snapshots by experimental SAXS data.","[Ekimoto, Toru; Ikeguchi, Mitsunori] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ikeguchi, Mitsunori] RIKEN, Med Sci Innovat Hub Program, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Ikeguchi, M (corresponding author), Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.; Ikeguchi, M (corresponding author), RIKEN, Med Sci Innovat Hub Program, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",ekimoto@yokohama-cu.ac.jp; ike@yokohama-cu.ac.jp,,,,,,82,4,4,1,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0065-2598,2214-8019,978-981-13-2200-6; 978-981-13-2199-3,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2018,1105,,,,,,237,258,,10.1007/978-981-13-2200-6_15,10.1007/978-981-13-2200-6,,22,"Biology; Biophysics; Medicine, Research & Experimental",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biophysics; Research & Experimental Medicine,BL9QC,WOS:000458020900015,30617833,,,,2020-11-19,

If these CVs are coincident with the slow collective modes governing the long-time dynamical evolution, then they also furnish good coordinates in which to perform enhanced sampling to surmount high free energy barriers and efficiently explore and recover the landscape. Non-linear manifold learning techniques provide a means to systematically extract such CVs from molecular simulation trajectories by identifying and extracting low-dimensional manifolds lying latent within the high-dimensional coordinate space. We survey recent advances in data-driven CV discovery and enhanced sampling using non-linear manifold learning, describe the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of these techniques, and present illustrative examples to molecular folding and colloidal self-assembly.

This is largely due to a shortage of atomically detailed models for the ensemble of relevant protein conformations and their relative populations. For example, the M182T substitution in TEM beta-lactamase, an enzyme that confers antibiotic resistance to bacteria, is stabilizing but the precise mechanism remains unclear. Here, we employ Markov state models (MSMs) to uncover how M182T shifts the distribution of different structures that TEM adopts. We find that M182T stabilizes a helix that is a key component of a domain interface. We then predict the effects of other mutations, including a novel stabilizing mutation, and experimentally test our predictions using a combination of stability measurements, crystallography, NMR, and in vivo measurements of bacterial fitness. We expect our insights and methodology to provide a valuable foundation for protein design.","[Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Hart, Kathryn M.; Sibbald, Carrie A.; Frederick, Thomas E.; Knoverek, Catherine R.; Tolia, Niraj H.; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 660 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Jimah, John R.; Tolia, Niraj H.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Microbiol, 660 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Hart, Kathryn M.] Williams Coll, Dept Chem, 880 Main St, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 660 South Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",g.bowman@wustl.edu,"Hart, Kathryn/AAE-1983-2019; Tolia, Niraj H/D-2332-2014","Hart, Kathryn/0000-0002-5277-8872; Tolia, Niraj H/0000-0002-2689-1337; Jimah, John/0000-0003-2835-433X","NSF CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [MCB-1552471]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM12400701]; Burroughs Wellcome FundBurroughs Wellcome Fund; David & Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was funded by NSF CAREER Award MCB-1552471 and NIH R01GM12400701.

However, proficient organophosphatases such as serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and the organophosphate-hydrolyzing lactonase SsoPox are unable to hydrolyze bulkyorganophosphates with challenging leaving groups such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) or venomous agent X, creating a major challenge for enzyme design. Curiously, despite their mutually exclusive substrate specificities, PON1 and diisopropyl fluorophosphatase (DFPase) have essentially identical active sites and tertiary structures. In the present work, we use empirical valence bond simulations to probe the catalytic mechanism of DFPase as well as temperature, pH, and mutational effects, demonstrating that DFPase and PON1 also likely utilize identical catalytic mechanisms to hydrolyze their respective substrates. However, detailed examination of both static structures and dynamical simulations demonstrates subtle but significant differences in the electrostatic properties and solvent penetration of the two active sites and, most critically, the role of residues that make no direct contact with either substrate in acting as specificity switches between the two enzymes. Specifically, we demonstrate that key residues that are structurally and functionally critical for the paraoxonase activity of PON1 prevent it from being able to hydrolyze DFP with its fluoride leaving group. These insights expand our understanding of the drivers of the evolution of divergent substrate specificity in enzymes with identical active sites and guide the future design of organophosphate hydrolases that hydrolyze compounds with challenging leaving groups.","[Purg, Miha; Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn] Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Sci Life Lab, BMC Box 596, S-75124 Uppsala, Sweden; [Elias, Mikael] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Elias, Mikael] Univ Minnesota, Biotechnol Inst, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Kamerlin, SCL (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Sci Life Lab, BMC Box 596, S-75124 Uppsala, Sweden.",kamerlin@icm.uu.se,"Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn/G-9554-2011","Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn/0000-0002-3190-1173; Elias, Mikael/0000-0003-0406-7539",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; BTI Biocatalysis Initiative; European Research Council under European Community's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC [306474],"We thank the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation for a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship to S.C.L.K.

Design of selective BTK therapeutics would benefit from improved, in-silico structural modeling of the kinase's solution ensemble.

In this work, we combine multi-millisecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Markov state models (MSMs) to report on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and accessible states of BTK's kinase domain. Our conformational landscape links the active state to several inactive states, connected via a structurally diverse intermediate. Our calculations predict a kinome-wide conformational plasticity, and indicate the presence of several new potentially druggable BTK states. We further find that the population of these states and the kinetics of their inter-conversion are modulated by protonation of an aspartate residue, establishing the power of MD & MSMs in predicting effects of chemical perturbations.","[Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Denny, Rajiah Aldrin; Unwalla, Ray; Lovering, Frank] Pfizer Inc, Med Design, Worldwide Res & Dev, 610 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Denny, RA (corresponding author), Pfizer Inc, Med Design, Worldwide Res & Dev, 610 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",Aldrin.Denny@pfizer.com; Pande@stanford.edu,,, [NSF-MCB-0954714],"M.M.S acknowledges support from NSF-MCB-0954714.

This equation cannot be solved in general but we present several approximations that are valid either in the low temperature regime or in the presence of barrier crossing. We show that this method warrants the generation of statistically independent transition paths. It is computationally very efficient.

Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.

Static analysis of reaction pathway often fails to sufficiently characterize excited state motions due to their highly non-equilibrium nature. Here, we proposed a time series guided clustering algorithm to generate most relevant meta-stable patterns directly from ab initio dynamic trajectories. Based on the knowledge of these meta-stable patterns, we suggested an interpolation scheme with only a concrete and finite set of known patterns to accurately predict the ground and excited state properties of the entire dynamics trajectories, namely, the prediction with ensemble models (PEM). As illustrated with the example of sinapic acids, The PEM method does not require any training data beyond the clustering algorithm, and the estimation error for both ground and excited state is very close, which indicates one could predict the ground and excited state molecular properties with similar accuracy. These results may provide us some in sights to construct molecular mechanism models with compatible energy terms as traditional force fields.","[Liu, Fang; Du, Likai; Gao, Jun] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Informat, Hubei Key Lab Agr Bioinformat, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Dongju] Shandong Univ, Inst Theoret Chem, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China","Du, LK; Gao, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Informat, Hubei Key Lab Agr Bioinformat, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",dulikai@mail.hzau.edu.cn; gaojun@sdu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21503249, 21373124]; Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation [2015RC008]; Fundamental Founds for the Central Universities [2662016QD011, 2662015PY113]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund [U1501501]","The work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos 21503249, 21373124), and Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific & Technological Self-innovation Foundation (Program No. 2015RC008), and Project 2662016QD011 and 2662015PY113Supported by the Fundamental Founds for the Central Universities.

To test the accuracy of simulation-based hairpin design, we characterized the folding properties of a series of so-called beta-cap hairpin peptides designed to mimic a conserved hairpin of LapD, a bacterial intracellular signaling protein, both experimentally by NMR spectroscopy and computationally by implicit-solvent replica-exchange molecular dynamics using three different AMBER force fields (ff96, ff99sb-ildn, and ff99sb-ildn-NMR). A unique challenge presented by these designs is the presence of both a terminal Trp-Trp capping motif and a conserved GWxQ motif in the hairpin turn required for binding to LapG. Consistent with previous studies, we found AMBER ff96 to be the most accurate when used with the OBC GBSA implicit solvent model, despite its known bias toward beta-sheet conformations when used in explicit-solvent simulations. To gain microscopic insight into the folding landscape of the hairpin designs, we additionally performed parallel simulations on the Folding@home distributed computing platform using AMBER ff99sb-ildn-NMR with TIP3P explicit solvent. Markov state models (MSMs) built from trajectory data reveal a number of non-native interactions between Trp and other amino acid side chains, creating potential problems in achieving well-folded hairpin structures in solution.","[Ge, Yunhui; Voelz, Vincent A.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Kier, Brandon L.; Andersen, Niels H.] Univ Washington, Dept Chem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Voelz, VA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",voelz@temple.edu,"Ge, Yunhui/I-1514-2018","Ge, Yunhui/0000-0002-3946-1440; Voelz, Vincent/0000-0002-1054-2124","National Science Foundation through Major Research Instrumentation Grant [CNS-09-58854, MCB-1412508]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412508] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412508] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through Major Research Instrumentation Grant CNS-09-58854 and MCB-1412508.,,78,3,3,1,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,1549-960X,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.
