Using molecular dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent model, an ensemble of folding trajectories from unfolded (practically extended) states of the protein to the native state was generated. To get insight into the folding kinetics, the free energy surface and kinetic network projected on this surface were constructed. This, conventional analysis of the folding reaction was followed by a recently proposed hydrodynamic description of protein folding (Chekmarev et al. in Phys Rev Lett 100(1):018107, 2008), in which the process of the first-passage folding is viewed as a stationary flow of a folding fluid from the unfolded to native state. This approach is conceptually different from the previously used approaches and thus allows an alternative view of the folding dynamics and kinetics of Trp-cage, the conclusions about which are very diverse. In agreement with most previous studies, we observed two characteristic folding pathways: in one pathway (I), the collapse of the hydrophobic core precedes the formation of the -helix, and in the other pathway (II), these events occur in the reverse order. We found that although pathway II is complicated by a repeated partial protein unfolding, it contributes to the total folding flow as little as a parts per thousand 10 %, so that the folding kinetics remain essentially single-exponential.","[Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.; Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",vladimir.andryushchenko@gmail.com; chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru,,,Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00325],This work was performed under a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (No. 14-14-00325).,,58,7,7,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0175-7571,1432-1017,,EUR BIOPHYS J BIOPHY,Eur.

However, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the folding mechanisms observed because experiments cannot yet directly resolve events occurring along the transition paths between unfolded and folded states. Protein folding.-values provide residue-resolved information about folding mechanisms by comparing the effects of mutations on folding rates and stability, but determining.-values by separately simulating mutant proteins would be computationally demanding and prone to large statistical errors. Here we use transition path theory to develop a method for computing phi-values directly from the transition path ensemble, without the need for additional simulations. This path-based approach uses the full transition path information available from equilibrium folding and unfolding trajectories, or from transition path sampling, and does not require identification of folding transition states. Applying our approach to a set of simulations of 10 small proteins by Shaw and coworkers [Lindorff-Larsen K, Piana S, Dror RO, Shaw DE (2011) Science 334(6055): 517-520; Piana S, Lindorff-Larsen K, Shaw DE (2011) Biophys J 100(9): L47-L49; and Piana S, Lindorff-Larsen K, Shaw DE (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(15): 5915-5920], we find good agreement with experiments in most cases where data are available. We can further resolve the contributions to fractional.-values coming from partial contact formation versus transition path heterogeneity. Although in some cases, there is substantial heterogeneity of folding mechanism, in others, such as Ubiquitin, the mechanism is strongly conserved.","[Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hummer, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.; Hummer, G (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov; gehummer@biophys.mpg.de,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",R.B.B. was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.

Here we demonstrate a general formalism to couple such NH equations. We provide a coupled NH equation that is constructed by coupling the NH equation of a target physical system and the NH equation of a temperature system. Thus, in contrast to the conventional single NH equation, the heat-bath temperature is a dynamical variable. The temperature fluctuations are not ad hoc, but instead are generated by the newly defined temperature system, and the statistical distribution of the temperature is completely described with an arbitrarily given probability function. The current equations of motion thus describe the physical system that develops with a predistributed fluctuating temperature, which allows enhanced sampling of the physical system. Since the total system is governed by a prescribed distribution, the equilibrium of the physical system is also reconstructed by reweighting. We have formulated a scheme for specifically setting the distribution of the dynamical inverse temperature and demonstrate the statistical relationship between the dynamical and physical temperatures. The statistical features, dynamical properties, and sampling abilities of the current method are demonstrated via the distributions, trajectories, dynamical correlations, and free energy landscapes for both a model system and a biomolecular system. These results indicated that the current coupled NH scheme works well.","[Fukuda, Ikuo] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Moritsugu, Kei] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Fukuda, I (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",ifukuda@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25390156, 15K18520]; Japan Agency for Medical Research and development, AMEDJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K18520] Funding Source: KAKEN","I.F. is grateful for a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (Grant No. 25390156) and K.M. was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (Grant No. 15K18520), both from JSPS.

Here, the changes in free energies of solvation upon folding of several fast folding proteins are calculated from previously run s-ms simulations with a number of implicit solvent models and compared to the values needed to be consistent with the explicit solvent model used in the simulations. In the majority of cases, there is a significant and substantial difference between the values calculated from the two approaches that is robust to the details of the calculations. These differences could only be remedied by selecting values for the model parametersthe internal dielectric constant for the polar term and the surface tension coefficient for the nonpolar termthat were system-specific or physically unrealistic.

Nowadays the concept of protein dynamics is formulated in terms of the energy landscape theory, which can be used to understand protein folding and conformational changes in proteins. Because protein dynamics are so important, a key to understanding protein function at the molecular level is to design experiments that allow their quantitative analysis. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is uniquely suited for this purpose because major advances in theory, hardware, and experimental methods have made it possible to characterize protein dynamics at an unprecedented level of detail. Unique features of NMR include the ability to quantify dynamics (i) under equilibrium conditions without external perturbations, (ii) using many probes simultaneously, and (iii) over large time intervals. Here we review NMR techniques for quantifying protein dynamics on fast (ps-ns), slow (mu s-ms), and very slow (s-min) time scales. These techniques are discussed with reference to some major discoveries in protein science that have been made possible by NMR spectroscopy.","[Kovermann, Michael; Rogne, Per; Wolf-Watz, Magnus] Umea Univ, Dept Chem, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Kovermann, Michael] Univ Konstanz, Dept Chem, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany","Wolf-Watz, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Chem, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",magnus.wolf-watz@umu.se,,"Rogne, Per/0000-0002-3687-9200",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [KO4687/1-1],"This work was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council to M.

In this scheme the associated Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski equation for the probability density function is transformed into the imaginary-time Schrodinger equation with an effective Hamiltonian. The propagator for the time-dependent wave function is expressed in the framework of the path integral formalism, which can thus represent the dynamical behaviors of nonequilibrium molecular systems such as those conformational changes observed in protein folding and ligand docking. The present study then employs the diffusion Monte Carlo method to efficiently simulate the relaxation dynamics of wave function in terms of random walker distribution, which in the long-time limit reduces to the ground-state eigenfunction corresponding to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. Utilizing this classical-quantum correspondence, we can describe the relaxation processes of thermodynamic functions as an approach to the equilibrium state with the lowest free energy. Performing illustrative calculations for some prototypical model potentials, the temporal evolutions of enthalpy, entropy, and free energy of the classical systems are explicitly demonstrated. When the walkers initially start from a localized configuration in one- or two-dimensional harmonic or double well potential, the increase of entropy usually dominates the relaxation dynamics toward the equilibrium state. However, when they start from a broadened initial distribution or go into a steep valley of potential, the dynamics are driven by the decrease of enthalpy, thus causing the decrease of entropy associated with the spatial localization. In the cases of one- and two-dimensional asymmetric double well potentials with two minimal points and an energy barrier between them, we observe a nonequilibrium behavior that the system entropy first increases with the broadening of the initially localized walker distribution and then it begins to decrease along with the trapping at the global minimum of the potential, thus leading to the minimization of the free energy.

This article assesses whether such long timescale simulations improve our ability to calculate order parameters that describe conformational heterogeneity on ps-ns timescales or if force fields are now a limiting factor. Order parameters from experiment are compared with order parameters calculated in three different ways from simulations ranging from 10 ns to 100 mu s in length. Importantly, bootstrapping is employed to assess the variability in results for each simulation length. The results of 10-100 ns timescale simulations are highly variable, possibly explaining the variation in levels of agreement between simulation and experiment in published works examining different proteins. Fortunately, microsecond timescale simulations improve both the accuracy and precision of calculated order parameters, at least so long as the full exponential fit or truncated average approximation is used instead of the common longtime limit approximation. The improved precision of these long timescale simulations allows a statistically sound comparison of a number of modern force fields, such as Amber03, Amber99sb-ILDN, and Charmm27. While there is some variation between these force fields, they generally give very similar results for sufficiently long simulations. The fact that so much simulation is required to precisely capture ps-ns timescale processes suggests that extremely extensive simulations are required for slower processes. Advanced sampling techniques could aid greatly, however, such methods will need to maintain accurate kinetics if they are to be of value for calculating dynamical properties like order parameters.

Here we investigate how the knowledge of backbone conformations preferentially adopted by protein fragments, as contained in precalculated libraries known as structural alphabets (SA), can be used to explore the landscape of protein conformations in MD simulations. We find that (a) enhancing the sampling of native local states in both metadynamics and steered MD simulations allows the recovery of global folded states in small proteins; (b) folded states can still be recovered when the amount of information on the native local states is reduced by using a low-resolution version of the SA, where states are clustered into macrostates; and (c) sequences of SA states derived from collections of structural motifs can be used to sample alternative conformations of preselected protein regions.

However, the pathway of cotranslational folding has so far been described only for a few proteins, and therefore, it is unclear whether folding in the ribosome exit tunnel is a common feature for small protein domains. Here, we have analyzed nine small protein domains and determined at which point during translation their folding generates sufficient force on the nascent chain to release translational arrest by the SecM arrest peptide, both in vitro and in live E. coli cells. We find that all nine protein domains initiate folding while still located well within the ribosome exit tunnel.","[Marino, Jacopo; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Marino, Jacopo; Beckmann, Roland] Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [von Heijne, Gunnar] Stockholm Univ, Ctr Biomembrane Res, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Solna, Sweden; [von Heijne, Gunnar] Stockholm Univ, Sci Life Lab, Solna, Sweden","Marino, J (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Gene Ctr, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.; Marino, J (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, Feodor Lynen Str 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",marino@genzentrum.lmu.de,"von Heijne, Gunnar/F-5576-2011; von Heijne, Gunnar/AAH-9389-2019","von Heijne, Gunnar/0000-0002-4490-8569; Marino, Jacopo/0000-0001-7095-0800",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); Novartis Foundation for Biomedical Research; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2008-AdG 232648],"We are indebted to Prof. Eric R.

Architecturally, it is composed of a two-layer sandwich consisting of a four-stranded beta-sheet that packs against an alpha-helix. Using several bioinformatics approaches, we investigated which residues may be key determinants of this fold. We identified nine structurally conserved amino acids using a conservation analysis and propose they are critical to forming and stabilizing the fold. The nine conserved residues form a predominantly hydrophobic nucleus within the core of GB1. A network analysis of all the long-range interactions in the structure of GB1 in concert with a betweenness centrality analysis revealed the relative significance of each conserved amino acid residue based on the number and location of the interactions. This bioinformatics analysis provides an important foundation for the design and interpretation of both computational and experimental work which may be helpful in solving the protein folding problem.","[Collins, Jason C.; Bedford, John T.; Greene, Lesley H.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA","Greene, LH (corresponding author), Old Dominion Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",jccollin@odu.edu; jbedford@odu.edu; lgreene@odu.edu,"Collins, Jason/N-1207-2019","Collins, Jason/0000-0002-7653-0070",,,,55,1,1,0,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1536-1241,1558-2639,,IEEE T NANOBIOSCI,IEEE Trans.

While this is appropriate for particles representing atoms or molecules, objects with significant internal dynamics-like sequences of amino acids or even an entire protein-are poorly modelled by invariable particles. We develop a highly coarse grained polymorph patchy particle with the ultimate aim of simulating proteins as chains of particles at the secondary structure level. Conformational changes, e.g., a transition between disordered and beta-sheet states, are accommodated by internal coordinates that determine the shape and interaction characteristics of the particles. The internal coordinates, as well as the particle positions and orientations, are propagated by Brownian Dynamics in response to their local environment. As an example of the potential offered by polymorph particles, we model the amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered protein alpha-synuclein, involved in Parkinson's disease, as a single particle with two internal states. The simulations yield oligomers of particles in the disordered state and fibrils of particles in the misfolded cross-beta-sheet state. The aggregation dynamics is complex, as aggregates can form by a direct nucleation-and-growth mechanism and by two-step-nucleation through conversions between the two cluster types. The aggregation dynamics is complex, with fibrils formed by direct nucleation-and-growth, by two-step-nucleation through the conversion of an oligomer and by auto-catalysis of this conversion.

These two models are used to describe, respectively, folding in detergent micelles and folding within a bilayer, which effectively constrains GlpG's topology in unfolded and partially folded states. Structural free-energy landscape analysis shows that although the presence of multiple folding pathways is an intrinsic property of GlpG's modular functional architecture, the large entropic cost of organizing helical bundles in the absence of the constraining bilayer leads to pathways that backtrack (i.e., local unfolding of previously folded substructures is required when moving from the unfolded to the folded state along the minimum free-energy pathway). This backtracking explains the experimental observation of thermodynamically destabilizing mutations that accelerate GlpG's folding in detergent micelles. In contrast, backtracking is absent from the model when folding is constrained within a bilayer, the environment in which GlpG has evolved to fold. We also characterize a near-native state with a highlymobile transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) that is significantly populated under folding conditions when GlpG is embedded in a bilayer. Unbinding of TM5 from the rest of the structure exposes GlpG's active site, consistent with studies of the catalytic mechanism of GlpG that suggest that TM5 serves as a substrate gate to the active site.","[Schafer, Nicholas P.; Otzen, Daniel E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Mol Biol & Genet, Interdisciplinary Nanosci Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Truong, Ha H.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.",lindorff@bio.ku.dk; pwolynes@rice.edu,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039; Schafer, Nicholas/0000-0001-9789-2516","Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk Foundation; Danish Research CouncilDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF) [DFF-4090-00220]; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation [CF14-0287]; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM44557]; D.R.

This may be because chemical structures outside the chemical space in which life operates are incompatible with biochemistry, or because mechanisms to make or utilize such excluded structures has not evolved. In this paper I address the extent to which biochemistry is restricted to a small fraction of the chemical space of possible chemicals, a restricted subset that I call Biochemical Space. I explore evidence that this restriction is at least in part due to selection again specific structures, and suggest a mechanism by which this occurs. Results: Chemicals that contain structures that our outside Biochemical Space (UnBiological groups) are more likely to be toxic to a wide range of organisms, even though they have no specifically toxic groups and no obvious mechanism of toxicity. This correlation of UnBiological with toxicity is stronger for low potency (millimolar) toxins. I relate this to the observation that most chemicals interact with many biological structures at low millimolar toxicity. I hypothesise that life has to select its components not only to have a specific set of functions but also to avoid interactions with all the other components of life that might degrade their function. Conclusions: The chemistry of life has to form a dense, self-consistent network of chemical structures, and cannot easily be arbitrarily extended. The toxicity of arbitrary chemicals is a reflection of the disruption to that network occasioned by trying to insert a chemical into it without also selecting all the other components to tolerate that chemical. This suggests new ways to test for the toxicity of chemicals, and that engineering organisms to make high concentrations of materials such as chemical precursors or fuels may require more substantial engineering than just of the synthetic pathways involved.","[Bains, William] MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci Dept, 77 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Bains, William] Rufus Sci Ltd, 37 Moor, Royston SG8 6ED, Herts, England","Bains, W (corresponding author), MIT, Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci Dept, 77 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Bains, W (corresponding author), Rufus Sci Ltd, 37 Moor, Royston SG8 6ED, Herts, England.",bains@mit.edu,,,,,,156,2,2,0,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1752-0509,,BMC SYST BIOL,BMC Syst.

Here we have experimentally tested the role of charged residues on stability and folding kinetics of one of the most widely simulated beta-proteins, the WW domain. The folding of wild type Pint WW domain, which has two positively charged residues in the first turn, was compared to the fast folding mutant FiP35 Pin1, which introduces a negative charge into the first turn. A combination of FTIR spectroscopy and laser-induced temperature-jump coupled with infrared spectroscopy was used to probe changes in the amide I region. The relaxation dynamics of the peptide backbone, beta-sheets and beta-turns, and negatively charged aspartic acid side chain of FiP35 were measured independently by probing the corresponding bands assigned in the amide I region. Folding is initiated in the turns and the beta-sheets form last. While the global folding mechanism is in good agreement with simulation predictions, we observe changes in the protonation state of aspartic acid during folding that have not been captured by simulation methods. The protonation state of aspartic acid is coupled to protein folding; the apparent pK(a) of aspartic acid follow the dynamics of the intermediate phase, supporting assignment of this phase to formation of the first hairpin. These results demonstrate the importance of electrostatic interactions in turn stability and formation of extended beta-sheet structures.in the folded protein is 6.4.

Using molecular dynamics simulations; the denaturation of the prion structure with V176G at 500K was studied to identify the dynamics in structural properties such as salt bridge, solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobicity. The simulations revealed that the heat-induced unfolding caused destabilization of the native structure of PrP and affecting the a-sheet region of the structure more than the a-helix. Unique salt bridge formation suggests conformational orientation that may be attributed to the V176G mutation.

Experimentally, folding cooperativity has been difficult to study, but in recent years we have witnessed major advances. New analytical procedures in terms of conformational ensembles rather than discrete states, experimental techniques with improved time, structural, or single-molecule resolution, and combined thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of fast folding have contributed to demonstrate a general scenario of limited cooperativity in folding. Gradual structural disorder is already apparent on the unfolded and native states of slow, two-state folding proteins, and it greatly increases in magnitude for fast folding domains. These results demonstrate a direct link between how fast a single-domain protein folds and unfolds, and how cooperative (or structurally diverse) is its equilibrium unfolding process. Reducing cooperativity also destabilizes the native structure because it affects unfolding more than folding. We can thus define a continuous cooperativity scale that goes from the 'pliable' two-state character of slow folders to the gradual unfolding of one-state downhill, and eventually to intrinsically disordered proteins. The connection between gradual unfolding and intrinsic disorder is appealing because it suggests a conformational rheostat mechanism to explain the allosteric effects of folding coupled to binding.","[Munoz, Victor; Campos, Luis A.] CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3,Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Munoz, Victor; Campos, Luis A.] IMDEA Nanosci, Faraday 9,Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Munoz, Victor; Sadqi, Mourad] Univ Calif, Sch Engn, Merced, CA 95343 USA","Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3,Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), IMDEA Nanosci, Faraday 9,Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Sch Engn, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",vmunoz3@ucmerced.edu,"Sadqi, Mourad/J-3180-2018; Campos, Luis/A-1865-2019","Sadqi, Mourad/0000-0003-3553-3408; Campos, Luis/0000-0003-4788-9102","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness [CSD2009-00088, BIO2011-28092]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-ADG-323059]",This work was supported by grants CSD2009-00088 and BIO2011-28092 (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness) and ERC-2012-ADG-323059 (European Research Council).,,88,40,41,2,50,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0959-440X,1879-033X,,CURR OPIN STRUC BIOL,Curr.

It was shown experimentally that one Mg' ion can coordinate to both ADP molecules right after the chemical step of the catalytic reaction. During the substrate releasing and separation, the Mg2+ may transfer to one of the ADP molecules. However, it is unclear which ADP molecule binds with the Mg2+ during the substrate releasing. In this work, by using metadynamics method, we conducted molecular simulations on the adenylate kinase complexed with two ADP molecules and one Mg2+, which corresponds to the post catalysis enzyme-substrate complex. We constructed the free energy landscapes characterizing the Mg2+ transfer to the individual ADP molecules. Our results show that the Mg2+ has preference to attach with the ADP molecule of the LID domain. We found that only when the LID domain ADP is protonated, and simultaneously the NMP domain ADP is deprotonated, the Mg2+ tends to attach with the NMP domain ADP. We also characterized the ligand exchange and dehydration processes during the Mg2+ transfer.

Over the past 40 years, the timescales that can be simulated by atomistic MD are doubling every 1.3 years - which is faster than Moore's law. Thus, these advances are not simply due to the availability of faster computers. Force fields, solvation models and simulation methodology have kept pace with computing advancements, and are now quite good.

This landscape is sculpted through evolution by selecting amino-acid sequences that stabilize native interactions while suppressing stable non-native interactions that occur during folding. However, there is strong evolutionary selection for functional residues and these cannot be chosen to optimize, folding. Their presence impacts the folding energy landscape in a variety of ways. Here, we survey the effects of functional residues on folding by providing several examples. We then review how such effects can be detected computationally and be used as assays for protein function.

The structural properties of these intrinsically disordered peptides remain unclear despite extensive experimental and computational investigations. Further, there are mutations within A beta that change the way the peptide aggregates and are known to cause familial AD (FAD). Here, we analyze the ensembles of different isoforms (A beta 42 and A beta 40) and mutants (E22 Delta, D23N, E22K, E22G, and A2T in A beta 40) of A beta generated with all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the mu s/replica time scale. These were run using three different force field/water model combinations: OPLS-AA/L and TIP3P (OPLS), AMBER99sb-ILDN and TIP4P-Ew (ILDN), as well as CHARMM22* and TIP3SP (CHARMM). Despite fundamental changes in simulation parameters, we find that the resulting ensembles demonstrate a strong convergence in structural properties. In particular, antiparallel contacts between L17-A21 and A30-L34 are prevalent in ensembles of A beta 40, directly forming beta sheets in the OPLS and ILDN combinations. A21-A30 commonly forms an interceding region that rarely interacts with the rest of the peptide. Further, A beta 42 contributes new beta hairpin motifs involving V40-I41 in both OPLS and ILDN. However, the structural flexibility of the central region and the electrostatic interactions that characterize it are notably different between the different conditions. Further, for OPLS, each of the FAD mutations disrupts central bend character and increases the polymorphism of antiparallel contacts across the central region. However, the studied mutations in the ILDN set primarily encourage more global contacts involving the N-terminus and the central region, and promote the formation of new beta topologies that may seed different aggregates involved in disease phenotypes. These differences aside, the large degree of agreement between simulation sets across multiple force fields provides a generalizable characterization of A beta that is also consistent with experimental data and models.","[Rosenman, David J.; Wang, Chunyu; Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Rosenman, David J.; Wang, Chunyu; Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Wang, Chunyu] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Grad Program Biochem & Biophys, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Garcia, Angel E.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Biol, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.; Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.; Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, 110 Eighth St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.; Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",agarcia@lanl.gov,"Wang, Chunyu/AAH-5952-2019","Wang, Chunyu/0000-0001-5165-7959","National Institutes of Health-National Institute of General Medical Sciences Biomolecular Science and Engineering Training Grant [5 T32 GM067545-08]; Weissman Family Fellowship; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1050966]; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Grant [TG-MCB130178]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545, T32GM067545] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1050966] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Portions of this publication were previously, submitted in a thesis in partial fulfillment for the requirements of the Ph.D. for D.J.R.

Experimental and theoretical studies of the conformational dynamics of proteins are becoming in this respect essential to understand the origin of these anomalies. However, a description of the conformational dynamics of proteins based on mechano-energetic principles still remains elusive because of the intrinsic high flexibility of the peptide chains, the participation of weak noncovalent interactions, and the role of the ubiquitous water solvent. In this work, the conformational dynamics of trialanine dissolved in water (D2O) is investigated through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations combined with instantaneous normal modes (INMs) analysis both at equilibrium and after the vibrational excitation of the C-terminal amide I mode. The conformational equilibrium between a and pPII conformers is found to be altered by the intramolecular relaxation of the amide I mode as a consequence of the different relaxation pathways of each conformer which modify the amount of vibrational energy stored in the torsional motions of the tripeptide, so the alpha -> pPII and pPII -> alpha conversion rates are increased differently. The selectivity of the process comes from the shifts of the vibrational frequencies with the conformational changes that modify the resonance conditions driving the intramolecular energy flows.","[Bastida, Adolfo; Zuniga, Jose; Requena, Alberto] Univ Murcia, Dept Quim Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Miguel, Beatriz] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Ingn Quim & Ambiental, Cartagena 30203, Spain; [Emilia Candela, Maria] Univ Murcia, Dept Biol Vegetal, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Soler, Miguel Angel] Univ Udine, Dept Med & Biol Sci, I-33100 Udine, Italy","Bastida, A (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Quim Fis, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",bastida@um.es,"Soler, Miguel Angel/V-3879-2019; Requena, Alberto/H-9890-2015; Pascual, Adolfo Bastida/G-2102-2014; Miguel, Beatriz/K-4417-2014; SOLER, MIGUEL A./J-2389-2013; Candela, Maria Emilia/G-3013-2018","Requena, Alberto/0000-0002-9408-9493; Pascual, Adolfo Bastida/0000-0002-8193-9233; Miguel, Beatriz/0000-0002-5089-9259; SOLER, MIGUEL A./0000-0002-5780-9949; Candela, Maria Emilia/0000-0003-1308-6248",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [CSD2009-00038]; Fundacion Seneca del Centro de Coordinacion de la Investigacion de la Region de MurciaFundacion Seneca [19419/PI/14],This work was partially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion under Project CONSOLIDER CSD2009-00038 and by the Fundacion Seneca del Centro de Coordinacion de la Investigacion de la Region de Murcia under Project 19419/PI/14.,,65,6,7,0,26,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

All investigated methods sampled conformations close to available X-ray structures, but exhibited differently populated ensembles. The best force field / sampling combination was sufficiently accurate to predict that the solvated peptide fold is less ordered than in the crystallographic state, which was subsequently confirmed via circular dichroism and spectrofluorometric measurements.

A variety of organic solvents are used as additives for in vitro refolding of denatured proteins. Examination of the solvent effects on protein folding could be of fundamental importance to understand the molecular interactions in determining protein structure. This article investigated the folding of alpha-helix and beta-hairpin structures in water and the solutions of two representative refolding additives (methanol (MeOH) and 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (EMIM-Cl) ionic liquid) using REMD simulations. For both alpha-helix and beta-hairpin in MeOH/water solution or alpha-helix in EMIM-Cl/water solution, the transient structures along the folding pathway are consistent with the counterparts in water but the relative statistical weights are changed, leading to the decrease in the overall folding free energy barrier. Accordingly, MeOH promotes the folding of both alpha-helix and beta-hairpin but EMIM-Cl ionic liquid only promotes the folding of alpha-helix, consistent with experimental observations. The present study reveals for the first time the trivial effects on folding route but significant effects on folding thermodynamics from MeOH and EMIM-Cl, explaining the function of protein refolding additives and testifying the validity of the folding mechanism revealed by in vitro protein folding study using refolding additives.","[Yu, Yuqi; Wang, Jinan; Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jiye] UCB Biopharma SPRL, Braine Lalleud, Belgium","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn; Jiye.Shi@ucb.com; wlzhu@mail.shcnc.ac.cn,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400, 2012CB910403]; National 863 ProgramNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China [2012AA01A305]","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21373258), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400, 2012CB910403) and National 863 Program (Grant No. 2012AA01A305) for financial support.

It is an important model for protein folding studies, filling the gap between isolated alpha-helix and larger all-alpha domains. Here, we present, for the first time, successful folding simulations of an alpha-helical hairpin. Our RSFF1 and RSFF2 force fields give very similar predicted structures of this ata peptide, which is in good agreement with its NMR structure. Our simulations also give site-specific stability of alpha-helix formation in good agreement with amide hydrogen exchange experiments. Combining the folding free energy landscapes and analyses of structures sampled in five different ranges of the fraction of native contacts (Q), a folding mechanism of alpha t alpha is proposed. The most stable sites of Q9-E15 in helix-1 and E24-A30 in helix-2 close to the loop region act as the folding initiation sites. The formation of interhelix side-chain contacts also initiates near the loop region, but some residues in the central parts of the two helices also form contacts quite early. The two termini fold at a final stage, and the loop region remains flexible during the whole folding process. This mechanism is similar to the zipping out pathway of beta-hairpin folding.","[Zeng, Juan; Jiang, Fan; Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Jiang, F; Wu, YD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Wu, YD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jiangfan@pku.edu.cn; wuyd@pkusz.edu.cn,"Wu, Yun-Dong/G-8463-2013",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21133002, 21203004]; Shenzhen Peacock Program [KQTD201103]; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School; Nanshan District in Shenzhen [KC2014ZDZJ0026A]",We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21133002 for Y.-D.W. and 21203004 for F.J.) for the financial support.

To this end, the collapse or folding of single polymer chains into architecturally defined nanostructures is a rapidly growing research topic in polymer science. Many synthetic approaches have been developed for the formation of single-chain nanoparticles (SCNP), and a variety of characterization methods and computational efforts have been utilized to detail their formation and probe their morphological characteristics. Interest in this field continues to grow partially due to the variety of potential applications of SCNP including catalysis, sensors, nanoreactors, and nanomedicine. While numerous developments have been made, the field is continuing to evolve, and there are still many unanswered questions regarding synthesis and characterization of SCNP. This Perspective serves to identify recent accomplishments in the synthesis and characterization of SCNP while distinguishing areas that are in need of advancement and innovation to move forward. This includes exploring more complex synthetic strategies, obtaining folding control, employing nanoparticle functionalization, developing scalable methods, investigating hierarchical self-assembly of SCNP, and exploiting unique characterization techniques and in-depth simulations.","[Hanlon, Ashley M.; Lyon, Christopher K.; Berda, Erik B.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Chem, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Berda, Erik B.] Univ New Hampshire, Mat Sci Program, Durham, NH 03824 USA","Berda, EB (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Chem, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",Erik.Berda@unh.edu,,,University of New Hampshire; Army Research Office [W911NF-14-1-0177]; NISTNational Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA [70NANB15H060],"We graciously acknowledge financial support from the University of New Hampshire, the Army Research Office for support through award W911NF-14-1-0177, and NIST for support through award 70NANB15H060.",,99,132,134,2,166,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0024-9297,1520-5835,,MACROMOLECULES,Macromolecules,JAN 12,2016,49,1,,,,,2,14,,10.1021/acs.macromol.5b01456,,,13,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,DB2EV,WOS:000368322000002,,Bronze,Y,N,2020-11-19,

In one scheme, called IR-UV hole-filling spectroscopy, a single conformation is selectively excited with an IR pump laser via a distinct NH stretch vibration. After giving the vibrationally excited ions sufficient time to isomerize and re-cool in the trap, the new conformational redistribution is detected by UV photofragment spectroscopy. While we clearly observe a redistribution of the conformer populations due to isomerization, only those conformations that initially have population participate in this redistribution-we do not form conformers that were not initially present in the trap. In a second scheme, called IR-induced population transfer spectroscopy, we determine the fractional populations of the four stable conformations of Ac-Phe-(Ala)(5)-LysH(+) by scanning the IR laser while selectively detecting a specific conformation using UV photofragment spectroscopy.

Since the 1950' s, solvent exchange-based methods have been the most powerful experimental means to obtain information on the folding and stability of proteins. Considerable expertise and care were required to obtain the resulting datasets, which, despite their importance and intrinsic value, have never been collected, curated and classified. Start2Fold is an openly accessible database (http://start2fold. eu) of carefully curated hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) data extracted from the literature that is open for new submissions from the community. The database entries contain (i) information on the proteins investigated and the underlying experimental procedures and (ii) the classification of the residues based on their exchange protection levels, also allowing for the instant visualization of the relevant residue groups on the 3D structures of the corresponding proteins. By providing a clear hierarchical framework for the easy sharing, comparison and (re-) interpretation of HDX data, Start2Fold intends to promote a better understanding of how the protein sequence encodes folding and structure as well as the development of new computational methods predicting protein folding and stability.","[Pancsa, Rita; Varadi, Mihaly; Tompa, Peter; Vranken, Wim F.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Pancsa, Rita; Varadi, Mihaly; Tompa, Peter; Vranken, Wim F.] VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr IB2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Tompa, Peter; Vranken, Wim F.] ULB VUB, Interuniv Inst Bioinformat Brussels IB2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Tompa, Peter] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Enzymol, Res Ctr Nat Sci, H-1113 Budapest, Hungary","Pancsa, R; Varadi, M; Vranken, WF (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Pancsa, R; Varadi, M; Vranken, WF (corresponding author), VIB, Struct Biol Res Ctr IB2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Vranken, WF (corresponding author), ULB VUB, Interuniv Inst Bioinformat Brussels IB2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",rpancsa@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk; mvaradi@ebi.ac.uk; wvranken@vub.ac.be,"Vranken, Wim F/J-5051-2016","Vranken, Wim F/0000-0001-7470-4324; Varadi, Mihaly/0000-0002-3687-0839; Tompa, Peter/0000-0001-8042-9939",Brussels Institute for Research and Innovation (Innoviris)Innoviris [BB2B 2010-1-12]; Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)FWO [G.0029.12],Brussels Institute for Research and Innovation (Innoviris) [BB2B 2010-1-12 to W.F.V.]; Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO) [Odysseus grant number G.0029.12 to P.T.].

New approaches are required to promote more efficient sampling. We present the design and implementation of the Extensible Toolkit for Advanced Sampling and analYsis (Ex-TASY) for building and executing advanced sampling workflows on HPC systems. ExTASY provides Python based templated scripts that interface to an interoperable and high-performance pilot-based run time system, which abstracts the complexity of managing multiple simulations. ExTASY supports the use of existing highly-optimised parallel MD code and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates which do not require a priori knowledge of the system to bias. We describe two workflows which both couple large ensembles of relatively short MD simulations with analysis tools to automatically analyse the generated trajectories and identify molecular conformational structures that will be used on-the-fly as new starting points for further simulation-analysis iterations. One of the workflows leverages the Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps technique; the other makes use of Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and generate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. We show that the ExTASY tools have been deployed on a range of HPC systems including ARCHER (Cray CX30), Blue Waters (Cray XE6/XK7), and Stampede (Linux cluster), and that good strong scaling can be obtained up to 1000s of MD simulations, independent of the size of each simulation.

The proposed method formulates the contacts prediction problem as a ranking problem. Firstly, the contact probabilities of residue pairs are predicted by ensemble machine-learning classifiers and correlated mutations approaches. And then, the proposed method integrates the complementary outputs of machine-learning and correlated mutations approaches and uses the learning-to-rank algorithm to rank residue pairs based on their probabilities to be contacts. Benchmarked on the CASP11 dataset, the proposed method achieves an improved performance for all three categories of contacts (short-range, medium-range and long-range contacts), which shows the proposed method based on learning-to-rank could take advantage of machine-learning and correlated mutations approaches and could provide the state-of-the-art performance.","[Jing, Xiaoyang] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Jing, Xiaoyang] Shanghai Key Lab Intelligent Informat Proc, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Dong, Qiwen] East China Normal Univ, Inst Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Dong, Qiwen] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Key Lab Network Oriented Intelligent Computat, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Dong, QW (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.; Dong, QW (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Key Lab Network Oriented Intelligent Computat, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qwdong@sei.ecnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61672234],Financial support was provided by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61672234),,55,0,0,1,4,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",2156-1125,,978-1-5090-1610-5,IEEE INT C BIOINFORM,,,2016,,,,,,,116,121,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Medical Informatics",Computer Science; Medical Informatics,BG9GY,WOS:000393191700018,,,,,2020-11-19,

By now, there is a wealth of methods designed to elucidate biomolecular structure and dynamics contributed from diverse scientific communities.

Upon changing the water model, the conformational order metrics of the peptide show significant differences in the unfolded rather than in the folded ensemble. The unfolding temperatures for Trp-cage are observed to be around 460, 470, and 430 K in mTIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P-Ew, respectively. Upon comparing the results with a previous study on a 16-residue beta-hairpin fragment of the 2GB1 protein, the same set of conformational order metrics are found to be insufficient in describing the free energy landscape of peptides having a distinct native secondary structure. However, the hydration shell properties of the peptide have been found to be independent of the sequence of the peptide and it changes in conformation upon unfolding. Our calculations reveal that for a particular water model, the secondary structure preferences in the unfolded ensembles of the two peptides are qualitatively different. The unfolded structures of Trp-cage prefer extended and compact structures in TIP4P-Ew and mTIP3P water, respectively, whereas the b-hairpin peptide prefers extended unfolded structures in mTIP3P. The conformational preferences of the unfolded peptide in a given water model have been found to depend on the peptide sequence, where the binding energies of the water molecules around the polar residues in the unfolded conformations show sensitivity to the multipole moments of the water models. The significance of an accurate description of peptide-solvent interactions in the parametrization of biomolecular force-fields, to obtain an accurate description of conformational preferences, in particular in the unfolded ensembles of proteins, is highlighted.","[Gupta, Madhulika; Nayar, Divya; Chakravarty, Charusita] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Chem, New Delhi 110016, India; [Bandyopadhyay, Sanjoy] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Mol Modeling Lab, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India","Bandyopadhyay, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Chem, Mol Modeling Lab, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",sanjoy@chem.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Nayar, Divya/ABD-7207-2020","Nayar, Divya/0000-0001-8569-7633","Department of Science and Technology, New DelhiDepartment of Science & Technology (India); IIT Delhi, New Delhi","CC was thankful to the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, for financial support.

Experimentally, large scale analysis has shown a nearly single uniform phi-value with normally distributed error from 24 different proteins; moreover, in zero stability conditions, the intrinsic variable phi(0) is around 0.36. To explore how and to what extent theoretical models can capture experimental phenomena, we here use structure-based explicit chain coarse-grained models to investigate the influence of single-point mutant perturbation on protein folding for single domain two-state proteins. Our results indicate that uniform, additive contact energetic interactions cannot predict experimental Bronsted plots well. Those points deviate largely from the main data sets in Bronsted plots, are mostly hydrophobic, and are located in N- and C-terminal contacting regions. Heterogenous contact energy, which is dependent on sequence separation, can narrow the point dispersion in a Bronsted plot. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining many-body interactions with heterogeneous native contact energy can present mean phi-values consistent with experimental findings, with a comparable distributed error. This indicates that for more accurate elucidation of protein folding mechanisms by residue-level structure-based models, these elements should be considered.","[Zhang, Zhuqing; Ouyang, Yanhua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Northwest Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,"Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31200548]; President Foundation A of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,We thank Prof. Hue Sun Chan for his insightful discussion.

The potential of mean force simulations usually require many, possibly parallelizable, short simulations instead of a few extremely long simulations and, therefore, are fairly manageable for most research facilities.

Here we used a combined NMR spin relaxation and unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) approach to investigate the exchange process by which a cavity in an L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme (T4L 99A) interconverts between an empty and occupied form that involves repositioning of an aromatic residue, Phe114. Although structures of the end-states of the exchange process are available, insight into the mechanism by which the transition takes place cannot be obtained from experiment and the timescales involved are too slow to address using brute force MD. Using spin relaxation NMR methods, we have identified a triple-mutant of T4L that undergoes the same exchange process as T4L L99A but where the minor state lifetime has decreased significantly so that the spontaneous conformational transition to the major state can be studied using all-atom MD simulations. The simulation trajectories were analyzed using Markov state models and the energy landscape so obtained is in good agreement with expectations based on NMR studies. Notably there is no large-scale perturbation of the structure during the transition, multiple intermediates are formed between the two similar exchanging conformations and the free energy barrier between these two well-folded, compact forms is small (6k(B)T), only slightly larger than for processes considered to be barrierless.","[Vallurupalli, Pramodh] TIFR Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, 21 Brundavan Colony, Hyderabad 500075, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Chakrabarti, Nilmadhab; Pomes, Regis; Kay, Lewis E.] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Pomes, Regis; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Vallurupalli, P (corresponding author), TIFR Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, 21 Brundavan Colony, Hyderabad 500075, Andhra Pradesh, India.; Kay, LE (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.; Kay, LE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.; Kay, LE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.; Kay, LE (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, 100 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",pramodh@tifrh.res.in; kay@pound.med.utoronto.ca,,,Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),This research was funded through grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (R.

However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.","[Valsson, Omar; Parrinello, Michele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Univ Swizzera Italiana Campus, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Valsson, Omar; Parrinello, Michele] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Sci Computat, Fac Informat, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Tiwary, Pratyush] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA","Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Univ Swizzera Italiana Campus, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.; Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Sci Computat, Fac Informat, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.",parrinello@phys.chem.ethz.ch,"Tiwary, Pratyush/N-2269-2017; Tiwary, Pratyush/M-8044-2019; Valsson, Omar/D-2438-2010","Valsson, Omar/0000-0001-7971-4767",,,,151,201,202,17,173,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-426X,,978-0-8243-1067-7,ANNU REV PHYS CHEM,Annu.

In previous work (Suarez et al., JCTC 2014;10:2658-2667), we demonstrated a non-Markovian analysis approach that, with a sufficient subset of history information, yields unbiased mean first-passage times from weighted-ensemble (WE) simulations. The estimation of the distribution of the first-passage times is, however, a more ambitious goal since it cannot be obtained by direct observation in WE trajectories. Likewise, a large number of events would be required to make a good estimation of the distribution from a regular brute force simulation. Here, we show how the previously developed non-Markovian analysis can generate approximate, but highly accurate, FPT distributions from WE data. The analysis can also be applied to any other unbiased trajectories, such as from standard molecular dynamics simulations. The present study employs a range of systems with independent verification of the distributions to demonstrate the success and limitations of the approach. By comparison to a standard Markov analysis, the non-Markovian approach is less sensitive to the user-defined discretization of configuration space.","[Suarez, Ernesto; Zuckerman, Daniel M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Pratt, Adam J.; Chong, Lillian T.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Zuckerman, DM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",ddmmzz@pitt.edu,,"Pratt, Audrey/0000-0002-5275-1020","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41 GM103712]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1119091, MCB-0845216]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Grant sponsor: NIH; Grant number: P41 GM103712; Grant sponsor: NSF; Grant numbers: MCB-1119091 and MCB-0845216.,,67,13,13,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,JAN,2016,25,1,,,SI,,67,78,,10.1002/pro.2738,,,12,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,DD3KJ,WOS:000369820800008,26131764,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2020-11-19,

One complication in interpreting such studies, however, is the fact that the typical size of a force probe (e.g., a dielectric bead in optical tweezers or the atomic force microscope tip/cantilever assembly) is much larger than the molecule itself, and so the observed molecular motion is affected by the hydrodynamic drag on the probe. This presents the experimenter with a nontrivial task of deconvolving the intrinsic molecular parameters, such as the intrinsic free energy barrier and the effective diffusion coefficient exhibited while crossing the barrier from the experimental signal. Here we focus on the dynamical aspect of this task and show how the intrinsic diffusion coefficient along the molecular reaction coordinate can be inferred from single-molecule measurements of the rates of biomolecular folding and unfolding. We show that the feasibility of accomplishing this task is strongly dependent on the relationship between the intrinsic molecular elasticity and that of the linker connecting the molecule to the force probe and identify the optimal range of instrumental parameters allowing determination of instrument-free molecular dynamics.","[Nam, Gi-Moon; Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Makarov, DE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",makarov@cm.utexas.edu,,,Robert A.

Among Kelch's ID? binding partners, NRF2 and PTMA are the two most interesting cases. They share a highly similar binding motif; however, NRF2 binds to Kelch with a binding affinity of approximately 100-fold higher than that of PTMA. In this study, we perform an exhaustive sampling composed of 6 mu s well-tempered metadynamics and 2 mu s unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aiming at characterizing the binding mechanisms and structural properties of these two peptides. Our results agree with previous experimental observations that PTMA is remarkably more disordered than NRF2 in both the free and bound states. This explains PTMA's lower binding affinity. Our extensive sampling also provides valuable insights into the vast conformational ensembles of both NRF2 and PTMA, supports the hypothesis of coupled folding binding, and confirms the essential role of linear motifs in IDP binding.","[Trang Nhu Do] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Trang Nhu Do] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo Inst Nanotechnol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Choy, Wing-Yiu] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Karttunen, Mikko] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Karttunen, Mikko] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Inst Complex Mol Syst, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands","Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",mkarttu@gmail.com,"Karttunen, Mikko/G-4531-2010; Choy, Wing-Yiu/O-7608-2017","Karttunen, Mikko/0000-0002-8626-3033; Choy, Wing-Yiu/0000-0002-2124-7278",University of Waterloo; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Financial support was provided by the University of Waterloo and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).,,85,17,17,0,45,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Of these environments, none is more complex than the cell itself, where proteins function in the cytosol, in membranes, and in different compartments. A wide variety of kinetic and thermodynamics experiments, ranging from single-molecule studies to jump kinetics and from nuclear magnetic resonance to imaging on the microscope, have elucidated how protein energy landscapes facilitate folding and how they are subject to evolutionary constraints and environmental perturbation.

Examples include skeletal tissues and biominerals, drug delivery systems, catalysts, sensors, separation media, energy conversion devices, and polymer nanocomposites. Current laboratory techniques are limited to monitor and manipulate assembly on the 1 to 100 nm scale, time-consuming, and costly. Computational methods have become increasingly reliable to understand materials assembly and performance. This review explores the merit of simulations in comparison to experiment at the 1 to 100 nm scale, including connections to smaller length scales of quantum mechanics and larger length scales of coarse-grain models. First, current simulation methods, advances in the understanding of chemical bonding, in the development of force fields, and in the development of chemically realistic models are described. Then, the recognition mechanisms of biomolecules on nanostructured metals, semimetals, oxides, phosphates, carbonates, sulfides, and other inorganic materials are explained, including extensive comparisons between modeling and laboratory measurements. Depending on the substrate, the role of soft epitaxial binding mechanisms, ion pairing, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and conformation effects is described. Applications of the knowledge from simulation to predict binding of ligands and drug molecules to the inorganic surfaces, crystal growth and shape development, catalyst performance, as well as electrical properties at interfaces are examined. The quality of estimates from molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations is validated in comparison to measurements and design rules described where available. The review further describes applications of simulation methods to polymer composite materials, surface modification of nanofillers, and interfacial interactions in building materials. The complexity of functional multiphase materials creates opportunities to further develop accurate force fields, including reactive force fields, and chemically realistic surface models, to enable materials discovery at a million times lower computational cost compared to quantum mechanical methods. The impact of modeling and simulation could further be increased by the advancement of a uniform simulation platform for organic and inorganic compounds across the periodic table and new simulation methods to evaluate system performance in silico.","[Heinz, Hendrik] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Heinz, Hendrik; Ramezani-Dakhel, Hadi] Univ Akron, Dept Polymer Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Ramezani-Dakhel, Hadi] Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Heinz, H (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",hendrik.heinz@colorado.edu,"Heinz, Hendrik/E-3866-2010; Heinz, Hendrik/AAB-8488-2020","Heinz, Hendrik/0000-0002-6776-7404; ","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-0955071, DMR-1437355, CBET-1530790]; AFOSRUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-14-1-0194]; ONR-MURIMURIOffice of Naval Research [N00014-14-1-0675]; ACS-PRFAmerican Chemical SocietyAmerican Cancer Society [54135-ND10]; Procter and Gamble; UES, Inc.; AFRLUnited States Department of DefenseUS Air Force Research Laboratory; Ohio Supercomputing Center, Research Computing at the University of Colorado-Boulder; Biofrontiers Compute Cluster at CU; University of Colorado-Boulder; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1530790] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The authors acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation (DMR-0955071, DMR-1437355, CBET-1530790), AFOSR (FA9550-14-1-0194), ONR-MURI (N00014-14-1-0675), ACS-PRF (54135-ND10), Procter and Gamble, UES, Inc., AFRL, the Ohio Supercomputing Center, Research Computing at the University of Colorado-Boulder, the Biofrontiers Compute Cluster at CU, and the University of Colorado-Boulder.",,358,106,107,12,263,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",0306-0012,1460-4744,,CHEM SOC REV,Chem.

Yet insufficient sampling of biomolecular configurations is often regarded as one of the main sources of error. Many enhanced sampling techniques have been developed to address this issue. Notably, enhanced sampling methods based on biasing collective variables (CVs), including the widely used umbrella sampling, adaptive biasing force and metadynamics, have been discussed in a recent excellent review (Abrams and Bussi, Entropy, 2014). Here, we aim to review enhanced sampling methods that do not require predefined system-dependent CVs for biomolecular simulations and as such do not suffer from the hidden energy barrier problem as encountered in the CV-biasing methods. These methods include, but are not limited to, replica exchange/parallel tempering, self-guided molecular/Langevin dynamics, essential energy space random walk and accelerated molecular dynamics. While it is overwhelming to describe all details of each method, we provide a summary of the methods along with the applications and offer our perspectives. We conclude with challenges and prospects of the unconstrained enhanced sampling methods for accurate biomolecular free energy calculations.","[Miao, Yinglong; McCammon, J.

Although many docking methods have been developed over the last three decades, the success of binding structure prediction remains greatly limited. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in assessing a docking pose predicted using a docking program. If the predicted pose is not unstable in an aqueous environment, MD simulation equilibrates the system and removes the ligand from the predicted position. Here we investigated two proteins that are important potential therapeutic targets: beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) and PR-Set7. While beta 2AR is rigid and its ligands are very similar to the template ligand (carazolol), PR-Set7 is very flexible and its ligands vary greatly from the template ligand (histone H4 tail peptide). On an empirical basis, we usually expect that the docking prediction is accurate when the protein is rigid and its ligands are similar to the template ligand.

This model was systematically applied to multiple proteins by Munoz and Eaton and has since been referred to as the Wako-Saito-Munoz-Eaton (WSME) model. The success of the WSME model in explaining the folding of many proteins has verified the hypothesis that the folding is dominated by native interactions, which makes the energy landscape globally biased toward native conformation. Using the WSME and other related models, Saito emphasized the importance of the hierarchical pathway in protein folding; folding starts with the creation of contiguous segments having a native-like configuration and proceeds as growth and coalescence of these segments. The Phi-values calculated for barnase with the WSME model suggested that segments contributing to the folding nucleus are similar to the structural modules defined by the pattern of native atomic contacts. The WSME model was extended to explain folding of multi-domain proteins having a complex topology, which opened the way to comprehensively understanding the folding process of multi-domain proteins. The WSME model was also extended to describe allosteric transitions, indicating that the allosteric structural movement does not occur as a deterministic sequential change between two conformations but as a stochastic diffusive motion over the dynamically changing energy landscape. Statistical mechanical viewpoint on folding, as highlighted by the WSME model, has been renovated in the context of modern methods and ideas, and will continue to provide insights on equilibrium and dynamical features of proteins.","[Sasai, Masaki; Chikenji, George; Terada, Tomoki P.] Nagoya Univ, Dept Computat Sci & Engn, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Sasai, Masaki; Chikenji, George; Terada, Tomoki P.] Nagoya Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan","Sasai, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Dept Computat Sci & Engn, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.; Sasai, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.",sasai@tbp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Terada, Tomoki P./I-6671-2014","Terada, Tomoki P./0000-0001-8231-9274","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H02217]; CREST of the Japan Science and Technology AgencyCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); Riken Pioneering Project Cellular Evolution; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H02217, 26610130] Funding Source: KAKEN","This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16H02217, CREST of the Japan Science and Technology Agency, and Riken Pioneering Project Cellular Evolution.",,74,2,2,0,1,BIOPHYSICAL SOC JAPAN,SUITA,"GRADUATE SCH FRONTIER BIOSCIENCES, OSAKA UNIV, 1-3 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, 565-0871, JAPAN",2189-4779,,,BIOPHYS PHYSICOBIOL,Biophys.

In itinerary profiling, structural clusters included in a trajectory are represented by a bit sequence, and a number of trajectories, as well as the structural clusters, can be compared and classified. As a consequence, the structural clusters that characterize the foldability of trajectories were able to be identified. The connections between the clusters were then illustrated as a network and the structural features of the clusters were examined. We found that in the true folding funnel, Trp-cage formed a left-handed main-chain topology and the Trp6 side-chain was located at the front of the main-chain ring, even in the initial unfolded states. In contrast, in the false folding funnel of the pseudo-native states, in which the Trp6 side-chain is upside down in the protein core, Trp-cage had a right-handed main-chain topology and the Trp side-chain was at the back. The initial topological partition, as determined by the main-chain handedness and the location of the Trp residue, predetermines Trp-cage foldability and the destination of the trajectory to the native state or the pseudo-native states.","[Ota, Motonori] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ikeguchi, Mitsunori; Kidera, Akinori] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan","Ota, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",mota@is.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K14714, 16H04780] Funding Source: KAKEN",,,53,1,1,0,1,BIOPHYSICAL SOC JAPAN,SUITA,"GRADUATE SCH FRONTIER BIOSCIENCES, OSAKA UNIV, 1-3 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, 565-0871, JAPAN",2189-4779,,,BIOPHYS PHYSICOBIOL,Biophys.

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field.","[Harder, Edward; Damm, Wolfgang; Maple, Jon; Wu, Chuanjie; Reboul, Mark; Xiang, Jin Yu; Wang, Lingle; Lupyan, Dmitry; Dahlgren, Markus K.; Knight, Jennifer L.; Kaus, Joseph W.; Cerutti, David S.; Krilov, Goran; Abel, Robert] Schrodinger Inc, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Friesner, Richard A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Jorgensen, William L.] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Harder, E (corresponding author), Schrodinger Inc, 120 West 45th St, New York, NY 10036 USA.",ed.harder@schrodinger.com,,,,,,75,888,886,23,182,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

The approach uses infrequent metadynamics, which has been shown to provide quantitative rates for rare events, accelerated by biasing the RMSD of the protein structure. The results are quantitatively verified against a large benchmark dataset using the model proteins chignolin and villin headpiece (HP35). Following this, we apply the algorithm to protein unfolding in ionic liquids and study the HP35 unfolding time in four different 20% (w/w) IL/water mixtures. An interesting agreement is obtained between the ordering of the anion effects and previously published experiments on anion-induced destabilization of ribonuclease A (RNase A). Additional simulations helped shed light on the molecular mechanisms that lead to accelerated unfolding in ILs that have a chaotropic or hydrophobic anion. Further simulations suggest that, in this case, the tendency of an IL to be structure forming or breaking (kosmotrope vs. chaotrope) in water is unrelated to the unfolding times. Instead, the chaotropic anions, which are also more hydrophobic, more readily bind residues from the hydrophobic core, leading to faster unfolding. This approach should be appropriate for a wide range of protein unfolding simulations in the future and aid in systematic discovery of molecular descriptors for biomolecule function in unique nanostructured environments.","[Tung, Hsin-Ju; Pfaendtner, Jim] Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Pfaendtner, J (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Chem Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jpfaendt@uw.edu,,"Pfaendtner, Jim/0000-0001-6727-2957",,,,67,23,23,2,13,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",2058-9689,,,MOL SYST DES ENG,Mol.

The power of atomistic simulations is that these are physics-based methods that satisfy Boltzmann's law, so they can be used to compute populations, dynamics, and mechanisms. But physical simulations are computationally intensive and do not scale well to the sizes of many important biomolecules. One way to speed up physical simulations is by coarse-graining the potential function. Another way is to harness structural knowledge, often by imposing spring-like restraints. But harnessing external knowledge in physical simulations is problematic because knowledge, data, or hunches have errors, noise, and combinatoric uncertainties. Here, we review recent principled methods for imposing restraints to speed up physics-based molecular simulations that promise to scale to larger biomolecules and motions.

Working towards a complete understanding of this process, one needs to cover the full diversity of existing folds and identify the general principles driving the process. Here, we want to understand and quantify the diversity in folding routes for a large and representative set of protein topologies covering the full range from all alpha helical topologies towards beta barrels guided by the key question: Does the majority of the observed routes contribute to the folding process or only a particular route? We identified a set of two-state folders among non-homologous proteins with a sequence length of 40-120 residues. For each of these proteins, we ran native-structure based simulations both with homogeneous and heterogeneous contact potentials. For each protein, we simulated dozens of folding transitions in continuous uninterrupted simulations and constructed a large database of kinetic parameters. We investigate folding routes by tracking the formation of tertiary structure interfaces and discuss whether a single specific route exists for a topology or if all routes are equiprobable. These results permit us to characterize the complete folding space for small proteins in terms of folding barrier.Delta G double dagger, number of routes, and the route specificity R-T.

It remains unclear how alpha-synuclein monomers undergo conformational changes leading to aggregation and formation of fibrils characteristic for the disease. In the present study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations (over 180 mu s in aggregated time) using a hybrid-resolution model, Proteins with Atomic details in Coarse-grained Environment (PACE), to characterize in atomic detail structural ensembles of wild type and mutant monomeric alpha-synuclein in aqueous solution. The simulations reproduce structural properties of alpha-synuclein characterized in experiments, such as secondary structure content, long-range contacts, chemical shifts, and (3)J(HNHC alpha)-coupling constants. Most notably, the simulations reveal that a short fragment encompassing region 38-53, adjacent to the non-amyloid-beta component region, exhibits a high probability of forming a beta-hairpin; this fragment, when isolated from the remainder of alpha-synuclein, fluctuates frequently into its beta-hairpin conformation. Two disease-prone mutations, namely, A30P and A53T, significantly accelerate the formation of a beta-hairpin in the stated fragment. We conclude that the formation of a beta-hairpin in region 38-53 is a key event during alpha-synuclein aggregation. We predict further that the G47V mutation impedes the formation of a turn in the beta-hairpin and slows down beta-hairpin formation, thereby retarding alpha-synuclein aggregation.

Besides the classical view, in which a large number of conformations characterize the unfolded state while the folded one is dominated by a single structure, recently a reassessment of the denatured state has been suggested. A growing amount of evidence indicates that not only the folded but also the unfolded state is at least partially organized. Here, we try to answer the question of how different protein dynamics is in folded and unfolded states by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on the model protein Trp-cage. Random matrix theory inspired analysis of the correlation matrices has been carried out. The spectra of these correlation matrices show that the low rank modes of Trp-cage dynamics are outside of the limit expected for a random system both in folded and in unfolded conditions. These findings shed light on the nature of the unfolded state of the proteins, suggesting that it is much less random than previously thought.","[Palese, Luigi L.] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs SMBNOS, I-70124 Bari, Italy","Palese, LL (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs SMBNOS, Piazza G Cesare Policlin, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",luigileonardo.palese@uniba.it,"Palese, Luigi Leonardo/AAB-2347-2019; Palese, Luigi Leonardo/N-1836-2016","Palese, Luigi Leonardo/0000-0002-3447-1535; Palese, Luigi Leonardo/0000-0002-3447-1535",University of Bari [CUP H93G13000170005],This work was supported by a grant from the University of Bari (CUP H93G13000170005).,,49,16,16,0,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

However, the accuracy of such an approximation and the number of dimensions required were not clear. For all-atom folding simulations of ten small proteins in explicit solvent we show that the folding dynamics can indeed be accurately described as diffusion on just a single coordinate, the fraction of native contacts (Q). The diffusion models reproduce both folding rates, and finer details such as transition-path durations and diffusive propagators. The Q-averaged diffusion coefficients decrease with chain length, as anticipated from energy landscape theory. Although the Q-diffusion model does not capture transition-path durations for the protein NuG2, we show that this can be accomplished by designing an improved coordinate Q(opt). Overall, one-dimensional diffusion on a suitable coordinate turns out to be a remarkably faithful model for the dynamics of the proteins considered.","[Zheng, Wenwei; Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Zheng, Wenwei/M-5031-2015","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; Zheng, Wenwei/0000-0002-9603-009X","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Bill Eaton, Gerhard Hummer, Attila Szabo, and Shoji Takada for helpful comments.

These high accuracy predictions sometimes retain structural errors due to incorrect templates or a lack of accurate templates in the case of low sequence similarity, making these structures inadequate in drug-design studies or molecular dynamics simulations. We have developed a new physics based approach to the protein refinement problem by mimicking the mechanism of chaperons that rehabilitate mis-folded proteins. The template structure is unfolded by selectively (targeted) pulling on different portions of the protein using the geometric based technique FRODA, and then refolded using hierarchically restrained replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations (hr-REMD). FRODA unfolding is used to create a diverse set of topologies for surveying near native-like structures from a template and to provide a set of persistent contacts to be employed during re-folding. We have tested our approach on 13 previous CASP targets and observed that this method of folding an ensemble of partially unfolded structures, through the hierarchical addition of contact restraints (that is, first local and then nonlocal interactions), leads to a refolding of the structure along with refinement in most cases (12/13). Although this approach yields refined models through advancement in sampling, the task of blind selection of the best refined models still needs to be solved. Overall, the method can be useful for improved sampling for low resolution models where certain of the portions of the structure are incorrectly modeled.

These features appear transiently in the trajectories and furthermore the stretches of uniformly high enrichment may only last 4-10 ps. The formation of the inner hydrophobic cavity was also linked to the active-like to inactive-like transition of the receptor, especially the so-called connector region. The best structural models provided significant and robust enrichment over three independent ligand sets.","[Vass, Marton; Tarcsay, Akos] Discovery Chem, H-1103 Budapest, Hungary; [Jojart, Balazs] Univ Szeged, Dept Chem Informat, Fac Educ, H-6725 Szeged, Hungary; [Bogar, Ferenc; Paragi, Gabor] Univ Szeged, Hungarian Acad Sci, MTA SZTE Supramol & Nanostruct Mat Res Grp, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary; [Paragi, Gabor] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Theoret Chem, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Keseru, Gyoergy M.] Hungarian Acad Sci, Res Ctr Nat Sci, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary","Tarcsay, A (corresponding author), ChemAxon Ltd, Zahony Str 7, H-1031 Budapest, Hungary.",akos.tarcsay@gmail.com,,"Keseru, Gyorgy M/0000-0003-1039-7809",National Brain Research Program [KTIA-NAP-13-1-2013-0001]; Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within 7th European Community Framework Programme,"This work was supported by the National Brain Research Program KTIA-NAP-13-1-2013-0001.

However, it is still difficult to simulate biologically relevant time scales without the use of specialized supercomputers. Here, we introduce a goal-oriented sampling method, called fluctuation amplification of specific traits (FAST), for extending the capabilities of commodity hardware. This algorithm rapidly searches conformational space for structures with desired properties by balancing trade-offs between focused searches around promising solutions (exploitation) and trying novel solutions (exploration). FAST was inspired by the hypothesis that many physical properties have an overall gradient in conformational space, akin to the energetic gradients that are known to guide proteins to their folded states. For example, we expect that transitioning from a conformation with a small solvent-accessible surface area to one with a large surface area will require passing through a series of conformations with steadily increasing surface areas. We demonstrate that such gradients are common through retrospective analysis of existing Markov state models (MSMs). Then we design the FAST algorithm to exploit these gradients to find structures with desired properties by (1) recognizing and amplifying structural fluctuations along gradients that optimize a selected physical property whenever possible, (2) overcoming barriers that interrupt these overall gradients, and (3) rerouting to discover alternative paths when faced with insurmountable barriers. To test FAST, we compare its performance to other methods for three common types of problems: (1) identifying unexpected binding pockets, (2) discovering the preferred paths between specific structures, and (3) folding proteins. Our conservative estimate is that FAST outperforms conventional simulations and an adaptive sampling algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. Furthermore, FAST yields both the proper thermodynamics and kinetics, allowing for a direct connection with kinetic experiments that is impossible with many other advanced sampling algorithms because they provide only thermodynamic information. Therefore, we expect FAST to be of great utility for a wide range of applications.","[Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",bowman@biochem.wustl.edu,,,Burroughs Wellcome FundBurroughs Wellcome Fund,We are grateful to Chris Ho for helpful suggestions to the figures.

However, a coherent detailed picture explicitly combining both is currently lacking, a problem that seriously limits the amount of information that can be extracted. An alternative to atomistic models with physics-based potentials is the native-centric (i.e., G (o) over bar type) coarse-grained models, which for many years have been successfully employed to qualitatively understand features of protein folding energy landscapes. Again, quantitative validation of G (o) over bar models against experimental equilibrium unfolding curves is often not attempted. Here we use an atomistic topology-based model to study the folding mechanism of PDD, a protein that folds over a marginal thermodynamic barrier of similar to 0.5 k(B)T at midpoint conditions. We find that the simulations are in exquisite agreement with several equilibrium experimental measurements including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), an observable that is possibly the most challenging to reproduce from explicit-chain models. The dynamics, inferred using a detailed Markov state model, display a classical Chevron-like trend with a continuum of relaxation times under both folding and unfolding conditions, a signature feature of downhill folding. The number of populated microstates and the connectivity between them are shown to be temperature dependent with a maximum near the thermal denaturation midpoint, thus linking the macroscopic observation of a peak in the DSC profile of downhill folding proteins and the underlying microstate dynamics. The mechanistic picture derived from our analysis thus sheds light on the intricate and tunable nature of the downhill protein folding ensembles. In parallel, our work highlights the power of coarse-grained models to reproduce experiments at a quantitative level while also pointing at specific directions for their improvement.","[Naganathan, Athi N.] Indian Inst Technol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [De Sancho, David] CIC nanoGUNE, E-20018 Donostia San Sebastian, Spain; [De Sancho, David] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain","Naganathan, AN (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",athi@iitm.ac.in; d.desancho@nanogune.eu,"De Sancho, David/C-4995-2009","De Sancho, David/0000-0002-8985-2685; Naganathan, Athi N/0000-0002-1655-7802",,,,73,4,4,0,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

Due to the increasing amount of experimental data, numerous protein folding models and predictors of protein folding rates have been developed in the last decade. The problem has also attracted the attention of scientists from computational fields, which led to the publication of several machine learning-based models to predict the rate of protein folding. Some of them claim to predict the logarithm of protein folding rate with an accuracy greater than 90%. However, there are reasons to believe that such claims are exaggerated due to large fluctuations and overfitting of the estimates. When we confronted three selected published models with new data, we found a much lower predictive power than reported in the original publications. Overly optimistic predictive powers appear from violations of the basic principles of machine-learning. We highlight common misconceptions in the studies claiming excessive predictive power and propose to use learning curves as a safeguard against those mistakes. As an example, we show that the current amount of experimental data is insufficient to build a linear predictor of logarithms of folding rates based on protein amino acid composition.","[Corrales, Marc; Cusco, Pol; Chen, Heng-Chang; Filion, Guillaume J.] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Genome Architecture Gene Regulat Stem Cells & Can, Barcelona, Spain; [Corrales, Marc; Cusco, Pol; Usmanova, Dinara R.; Chen, Heng-Chang; Bogatyreva, Natalya S.; Filion, Guillaume J.; Ivankov, Dmitry N.] Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, Barcelona, Spain; [Corrales, Marc; Cusco, Pol; Chen, Heng-Chang; Filion, Guillaume J.] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Spain Genome Architecture Gene Regulat Stem Cells, Barcelona, Spain; [Usmanova, Dinara R.; Bogatyreva, Natalya S.; Ivankov, Dmitry N.] Ctr Genom Regulat CRG, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Barcelona, Spain; [Usmanova, Dinara R.] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Bogatyreva, Natalya S.; Ivankov, Dmitry N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Prot Res, Lab Prot Phys, Pushchino 142292, Moscow Region, Russia","Ivankov, DN (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra UPF, Barcelona, Spain.",ivankov13@gmail.com,"Usmanova, Dinara Ravilevna/I-9370-2014; Ivankov, Dmitry/AAD-8104-2019; Cusco, Pol/J-8638-2015; Filion, Guillaume/G-9619-2015","Ivankov, Dmitry/0000-0002-8224-4118; Cusco, Pol/0000-0002-6523-2916; Filion, Guillaume/0000-0002-3473-1632; Bogatyreva, Natalya/0000-0002-1719-1136","Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-24-00157]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [335980_EinME]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, 'Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa' [SEV-2012-0208]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (including State Training Subprogram: predoctoral fellowships for the training of PhD students (FPI); CRG","NSB was supported by the Russian Science Foundation Grant 14-24-00157.

We examined their properties by standard MD simulations starting from the folded state and long T-REMD starting from the unfolded state, accumulating similar to 130 mu s of atomistic simulations. Antiparallel G-hairpins should spontaneously form in all stages of the folding to support lateral and diagonal loops, with sub-mu s scale rearrangements between them. We found no clear predisposition for direct folding into specific GQ topologies with specific syn/anti patterns. Our key prediction stemming from the T-REMD is that an ideal unfolded ensemble of the full GQ sequence populates all 4096 syn/anti combinations of its four G-stretches. The simulations can propose idealized folding pathways but we explain that such few-state pathways may be misleading. In the context of the available experimental data, the simulations strongly suggest that the GQ folding could be best understood by the kinetic partitioning mechanism with a set of deep competing minima on the folding landscape, with only a small fraction of molecules directly folding to the native fold. The landscape should further include non-specific collapse processes where the molecules move via diffusion and consecutive random rare transitions, which could, e.g. structure the propeller loops.","[Stadlbauer, Petr; Sponer, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Biophys, CS-61265 Brno, Czech Republic; [Kuehrova, Petra; Banas, Pavel; Otyepka, Michal] Palacky Univ, Dept Phys Chem, Fac Sci, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Koca, Jaroslav; Trantirek, Lukas; Sponer, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol, CEITEC, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Koca, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Natl Ctr Biomol Res, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Bussi, Giovanni] Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, I-34136 Trieste, Italy","Sponer, J (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Biophys, Kralovopolska 135, CS-61265 Brno, Czech Republic.",sponer@ncbr.muni.cz,"Koca, Jaroslav/E-4460-2012; Trantirek, Lukas/F-9923-2014; Bussi, Giovanni/A-1776-2009; Otyepka, Michal/D-1220-2017; Sponer, Jiri/D-9467-2012","Koca, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2780-4901; Bussi, Giovanni/0000-0001-9216-5782; Otyepka, Michal/0000-0002-1066-5677; Sponer, Jiri/0000-0001-6558-6186","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P208/11/1822]; project 'CEITEC-Central European Institute of Technology' [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LO1305]; Student Project [Palacky University] [IGA_PrF_2015_027]; European Organization for Molecular Biology [IG2535]; Marie-Curie Re-integration (ECOPOD)European Union (EU); European Research Council [S-RNA-S] [306662]; Praemium AcademiaeCzech Academy of Sciences","Czech Science Foundation [P208/11/1822]; project 'CEITEC-Central European Institute of Technology' [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [project No. LO1305]; Student Project [IGA_PrF_2015_027 of Palacky University to P.K, P.B., M.O.]; career development grant from the European Organization for Molecular Biology [IG2535] and Marie-Curie Re-integration (ECOPOD) [to L.T.]; European Research Council [S-RNA-S, 306662 to G.B]; Praemium Academiae [to J.S.].

While the investigation of systems in MD simulations is limited by very small time steps, MC methods are often stifled by low acceptance rates for moves that significantly perturb the system. In many Metropolis MC methods with hard potentials, the acceptance rate drops exponentially with the number of uncorrelated, simultaneously proposed moves. In this work, we discuss a multiparticle Acceptance Rate Optimized Monte Carlo approach (AROMoCa) to construct collective moves with near unit acceptance probability, while preserving detailed balance even for large step sizes. After an illustration of the protocol, we demonstrate that AROMoCa significantly accelerates MC simulations in four model systems in comparison to standard MC methods. AROMoCa can be applied to all MC simulations where a gradient of the potential is available and can help to significantly speed up molecular simulations.

A popular approach aimed at extracting dynamical information consists of projecting these trajectories into optimally selected reaction coordinates or collective variables. For equilibrium dynamics between any two boundary states, the committor function also known as the folding probability in protein folding studies is often considered as the optimal coordinate. To determine it, one selects a functional form with many parameters and trains it on the trajectories using various criteria. A major problem with such an approach is that a poor initial choice of the functional form may lead to sub-optimal results. Here, we describe an approach which allows one to optimize the reaction coordinate without selecting its functional form and thus avoiding this source of error. (C) 2015 Author(s).

We also found different variants have the same major folding pathway, including the well formed P-II-helix in the unfolded state, the formation of W6-P12/P18/P19 contacts and the a-helix before the transition state, the following formation of most native contacts, and the final native loop formation.

Fundamental to protein functionality is the utilization of these dynamics for tasks such as catalysis, folding, and allostery. A hierarchy of motion is hypothesized to connect and synergize fast and slow dynamics toward performing these essential activities. Population shuffling predicts a top-down temporal hierarchy, where slow time-scale conformational interconversion leads to a shuffling of the free energy landscape for fast time-scale events. Until now, population shuffling was only applied to interconverting ground states. Here, we extend the framework of population shuffling to be applicable for a system interconverting between low energy ground and high energy excited states, such as the SH3 domain mutants G48M and A39V/N53P/V55L from the Fyn tyrosine kinase, providing another tool for accessing the structural dynamics of high energy excited states. Our results indicate that the higher energy gauche- rotameric state for the leucine (2) dihedral angle contributes significantly to the distribution of rotameric states in both the major and minor forms of the SH3 domain. These findings are corroborated with unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on both the major and minor states of the SH3 domain demonstrating high correlations between experimental and back-calculated leucine (2) rotameric populations. Taken together, we demonstrate how fast time-scale rotameric side-chain population distributions can be extracted from slow time-scale conformational exchange data further extending the scope and the applicability of the population shuffling model.","[Sabo, T.

We then discuss experiments that can be used to subject proteins to low- and high-temperature unfolding, as well as low- and high-pressure unfolding. Pressure and temperature are prototypical perturbations that illustrate how close many proteins are to instability, a property that cells can exploit to control protein function.

Some unresolved issues and paradoxes related to quantum effects (Levinthal's paradox, the paradox of speed, and mechanisms of evolution) are addressed. It is concluded that the existence of non-trivial quantum effects is necessary for the functioning of living systems. In particular, it is demonstrated that classical mechanics cannot explain the stable work of the cell and any over-cell structures. The need for quantum effects is generated also by combinatorial problems of evolution. Their solution requires a priori information about the states of the evolving system, but within the framework of the classical theory it is not possible to explain mechanisms of its storage consistently. We also present essentials of so called quantum-like paradigm: sufficiently complex bio-systems process information by violating the laws of classical probability and information theory. Therefore the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory may have fruitful applications to describe behavior of bio-systems: from cells to brains, ecosystems and social systems. In quantum-like information biology it is not presumed that quantum information bio-processing is resulted from quantum physical processes in living organisms. Special experiments to test the role of quantum mechanics in living systems are suggested. This requires a detailed study of living systems on the level of individual atoms and molecules. Such monitoring of living systems in vivo can allow the identification of the real potentials of interaction between biologically important molecules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is caused by the fact that a vast amount of computer time is required to simulate short episodes from the life of biomolecules. Several approaches have been developed to overcome this obstacle, including application of massively parallel and special purpose computers or non-conventional hardware. Methodological approaches are represented by coarse-grained models and enhanced sampling techniques. These techniques can show how the studied system behaves in long time-scales on the basis of relatively short simulations. This review presents an overview of new simulation approaches, the theory behind enhanced sampling methods and success stories of their applications with a direct impact on biotechnology or drug design.

The original PaCS-MD comprises cycles of (0 selection of initial structures for multiple independent MD simulations toward a predetermined target and (ii) conformational sampling by the independent MDs. In nt-PaCS-MD, structures that significantly deviate from an average are regarded as candidates that have high potential to address other metastable states and are chosen as the initial structures in the selection. To select significantly deviated structures, we examine the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of snapshots generated from the average structure based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. nt-PaCS-MD was applied to the folding of the mini-protein chignolin in implicit solvent and to the open closed conformational transitions of T4 lysozyme (T4L) and glutamine binding protein (QBP) in explicit solvent. We show that nt-PaCS-MD can reach chignolin's native state and can also cause the open closed transition of T4L and QBP on a nanosecond time scale, which are very efficient in terms of conformational sampling and comparable to that with t-PaCS-MD.","[Harada, Ryuhei] Univ Tsukuba, Dept Phys, Grad Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Harada, Ryuhei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Kitao, Akio] Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan","Kitao, A (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Mol & Cellular Biosci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan.",kitao@iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kitao, Akio/B-8371-2008","Kitao, Akio/0000-0002-5221-0806","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young ScientistsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J03797, 26840056, 25104002, 15H04357]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15J03797, 15H04357, 26840056, 25104002] Funding Source: KAKEN","This research was supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (no. 15J03797) and a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from JSPS (no. 26840056) to RH., by a Grant-in-Aid in Innovative Areas (no. 25104002) and a Grant-in-Aid for Science Research B (no. 15H04357) to A.K. from JSPS and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan, and by Social and Scientific Priority Issues to be tackled using the Post K computer (achievement of a society that provides health and longevity, innovative drug discovery infrastructure through functional control of biomolecular systems) to A.K. from MEXT.",,50,21,21,0,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

We have carried out a series of extended (up to 10 mu s long, similar to 50 mu s in total) molecular dynamics simulations to explore conformational stability and loop dynamics of this quadruplex. Unfolding no-salt simulations are consistent with a multi-pathway model of quadruplex folding and identify the single-nucleotide propeller loops as the most fragile part of the quadruplex. Thus, formation of propeller loops represents a peculiar atomistic aspect of quadruplex folding. Unbiased simulations reveal mu s-scale transitions in the loops, which emphasizes the need for extended simulations in studies of quadruplex loops. We identify ion binding in the loops which may contribute to quadruplex stability. The long lateral-propeller loop is internally very stable but extensively fluctuates as a rigid entity. It creates a size-adaptable cleft between the loop and the stem, which can facilitate ligand binding. The stability gain by forming the internal network of GA base pairs and stacks of this loop may be dictating which of the many possible quadruplex topologies is observed in the ground state by this promoter quadruplex.","[Islam, Barira; Koca, Jaroslav; Sponer, Jiri] Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol CEITEC, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Stadlbauer, Petr; Krepl, Miroslav; Sponer, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Biophys, CS-61265 Brno, Czech Republic; [Koca, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Natl Ctr Biomol Res, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Neidle, Stephen; Haider, Shozeb] UCL, UCL Sch Pharm, London WC1N 1AX, England","Neidle, S (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Sch Pharm, 29-39 Brunswick Sq, London WC1N 1AX, England.",s.neidle@ucl.ac.uk; shozeb.haider@ucl.ac.uk; sponer@ncbr.muni.cz,"Sponer, Jiri/D-9467-2012; Krepl, Miroslav/F-3868-2019; Koca, Jaroslav/E-4460-2012; Haider, Shozeb/Q-1599-2019","Krepl, Miroslav/0000-0002-9833-4281; Koca, Jaroslav/0000-0002-2780-4901; Haider, Shozeb/0000-0003-2650-2925; Sponer, Jiri/0000-0001-6558-6186",Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [P208/11/1822]; 'CEITEC -Central European Institute of Technology' [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; Employment of Best Young Scientists for International Cooperation Empowerment [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); state budget of the Czech Republic; UCL School of Pharmacy Excellence Fellowship startup grant; UCL,"Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P208/11/1822]; 'CEITEC -Central European Institute of Technology' [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068 to J.S.]; Employment of Best Young Scientists for International Cooperation Empowerment [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0037], co-financed by the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic; Work in the SH group is supported by the UCL School of Pharmacy Excellence Fellowship startup grant.

Although experimental measurements of fundamental physical 0 properties offer a straightforward approach for evaluating force field quality, the bulk of this information has been tied up in formats that are not machine-readable. Compiling benchmark data sets of physical properties from non-machine-readable sources requires substantial human effort and is prone to the accumulation of human errors, hindering the development of reproducible benchmarks of force-field accuracy. Here, we examine the feasibility of benchmarking atomistic force fields against the NIST ThermoML data archive of physicochemical measurements, which aggregates thousands of experimental measurements in a portable, machine-readable, self-annotating IUPAC-standard format. As a proof of concept, we present a detailed benchmark of the generalized Amber small-molecule force field (GAFF) using the AM1-BCC charge model against experimental measurements (specifically, bulk liquid densities and static dielectric constants at ambient pressure) automatically extracted from the archive and discuss the extent of data available for use in larger scale (or continuously performed) benchmarks. The results of even this limited initial benchmark highlight a general problem with fixed-charge force fields in the representation low-dielectric environments, such as those seen in binding cavities or biological membranes.","[Beauchamp, Kyle A.; Chodera, John D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Behr, Julie M.] Weill Cornell Med

Because such paths are curves in a high-dimensional space, it has been difficult to quantitatively compare multiple paths, a necessary prerequisite to, for instance, assess the quality of different algorithms. We introduce a method named Path Similarity Analysis (PSA) that enables us to quantify the similarity between two arbitrary paths and extract the atomic-scale determinants responsible for their differences. PSA utilizes the full information available in 3N-dimensional configuration space trajectories by employing the Hausdorff or Frechet metrics (adopted from computational geometry) to quantify the degree of similarity between piecewise-linear curves. It thus completely avoids relying on projections into low dimensional spaces, as used in traditional approaches. To elucidate the principles of PSA, we quantified the effect of path roughness induced by thermal fluctuations using a toy model system. Using, as an example, the closed-to-open transitions of the enzyme adenylate kinase (AdK) in its substrate-free form, we compared a range of protein transition path-generating algorithms. Molecular dynamics-based dynamic importance sampling (DIMS) MD and targeted MD (TMD) and the purely geometric FRODA (Framework Rigidity Optimized Dynamics Algorithm) were tested along with seven other methods publicly available on servers, including several based on the popular elastic network model (ENM). PSA with clustering revealed that paths produced by a given method are more similar to each other than to those from another method and, for instance, that the ENM-based methods produced relatively similar paths. PSA applied to ensembles of DIMS MD and FRODA trajectories of the conformational transition of diphtheria toxin, a particularly challenging example, showed that the geometry-based FRODA occasionally sampled the pathway space of force field-based DIMS MD. For the AdK transition, the new concept of a Hausdorff-pair map enabled us to extract the molecular structural determinants responsible for differences in pathways, namely a set of conserved salt bridges whose charge-charge interactions are fully modelled in DIMS MD but not in FRODA. PSA has the potential to enhance our understanding of transition path sampling methods, validate them, and to provide a new approach to analyzing conformational transitions.","[Seyler, Sean L.; Kumar, Avishek; Thorpe, M.

In this study, a practical approach to the living polymerization of functionalized oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate monomers allows the incorporation of self-constituted multiple hydrogen-bonded groups into physically cross-linked polymer networks, which enables the formation of highly functionalized SCPNs in an aqueous environment. The newly developed materials are particularly attractive from a practical point of view since they have a very low critical micellization concentration and uniform particle diameters of ca. 25 nm, making them extremely stable under dilute conditions. Concentration-dependent experiments showed that SCPNs formed at polymer concentrations up to 40 mg/mL with no significant change in morphology observed. Moreover, the formed SCPNs had a very high stability in an aqueous solution containing surfactant, suggesting potential for a wide variety of applications as a promising candidate nanocarrier for bioimaging, controlled release, and drug delivery systems.","[Cheng, Chih-Chia] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Appl Sci & Technol, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Chang, Feng-Chih; Yen, Hsiu-Che] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Appl Chem, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan; [Lee, Duu-Jong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Lee, Duu-Jong] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Chiu, Chih-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Taipei 10607, Taiwan; [Xin, Zhong] E China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Chem Engn, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China","Cheng, CC (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Appl Sci & Technol, Taipei 10607, Taiwan.",cccheng@mail.ntust.edu.tw,"Chiu, Chih-Wei/B-3252-2010",,"Aim for the Top University Plan of National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2221-E-011-153]","This study was supported financially by Aim for the Top University Plan of the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (contract no.

When coupled with accurate solvation models, force fields are able to bring insight into the conformational preferences, transitions, pathways, and free energies for these biomolecules. When computational speed/cost matters, implicit solvent is often used but at the cost of accuracy. We present an empirical grid-like correction term, in the spirit of cMAPs, to the combination of the ff12SB protein force field and the GBneck2 implicit-solvent model. Ff12SB-cMAP is parametrized on experimental helicity data. We provide validation on a set of peptides and proteins. Ff12SB-cMAP successfully improves the secondary structure biases observed in ff12SB + Gbnecla.

Here, we present a novel computational approach that dissects the protein configurational entropy on the basis of the classification of protein dynamics on the landscape into two separate components: short-term vibrational dynamics related to individual free-energy wells and long-term conformational dynamics associated with transitions between wells. We apply this method to separate the configurational entropy of the protein villin headpiece subdomain into its conformational and vibrational components. We find that the change in configurational entropy upon folding is dominated by the conformational entropy despite the fact that the magnitude of the vibrational entropy is the significantly larger component in each of the folded and unfolded states, which is in accord with the previous empirical estimations. The straightforward applicability of our method to unfolded proteins promises a wide range of applications, including those related to intrinsically disordered proteins.","[Chong, Song-Ho; Ham, Sihyan] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul 140742, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,Samsung Science and Technology Foundation [SSTF-BA1401-13],This work was supported by Samsung Science and Technology Foundation under project number SSTF-BA1401-13.,,46,10,10,1,25,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,1520-5207,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

The correct folding of the active site and ribozyme tertiary structure is also regulated by metal ions in a manner that is not fully understood. Here we employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to show that individual structural elements of the group I ribozyme from the bacterium Azoarcus form spontaneously in the unfolded ribozyme even at very low Mg2+ concentrations, and are transiently stabilized by the coordination of Mg2+ ions to specific nucleotides. However, competition for scarce Mg2+ and topological constraints that arise from chain connectivity prevent the complete folding of the ribozyme. A much higher Mg2+ concentration is required for complete folding of the ribozyme and stabilization of the active site. When Mg2+ is replaced by Ca2+ the ribozyme folds, but the active site remains unstable. Our results suggest that group I ribozymes utilize the same interactions with specific metal ligands for both structural stability and chemical activity.","[Denesyuk, Natalia A.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Biophys Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Thirumalai, D (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",thirum@umd.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 13-61946],This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (CHE 13-61946).,,48,41,41,0,54,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1755-4330,1755-4349,,NAT CHEM,Nat.

However, the temporal resolution of a standard commercial cantilever is 50-1000 mu s, masking rapid transitions and short-lived intermediates. Recently, SMFS with 0.7-mu s temporal resolution was achieved using an ultrashort (L = 9 mu m) cantilever on a custom-built, high-speed AFM. By micro-machining such cantilevers with a focused ion beam, we optimized them for SMFS rather than tapping-mode imaging. To enhance usability and throughput, we detected the modified cantilevers on a commercial AFM retrofitted with a detection laser system featuring a 3-mu m circular spot size. Moreover, individual cantilevers were reused over multiple days. The improved capabilities of the modified cantilevers for SMFS were showcased by unfolding a polyprotein, a popular biophysical assay. Specifically, these cantilevers maintained a 1-mu s response time while eliminating cantilever ringing (Q congruent to 0.5). We therefore expect such cantilevers, along with the instrumentational improvements to detect them on a commercial AFM, to accelerate high-precision AFM-based SMFS studies.","[Edwards, Devin T.; Faulk, Jaevyn K.; Bull, Matthew S.; Walder, Robert; Perkins, Thomas T.] NIST, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Edwards, Devin T.; Faulk, Jaevyn K.; Bull, Matthew S.; Walder, Robert; Perkins, Thomas T.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Sanders, Aric W.] NIST, Quantum Elect & Photon Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [LeBlanc, Marc-Andre; Sousa, Marcelo C.] Univ Colorado, Dept Chem & Biochem, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Perkins, Thomas T.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Perkins, TT (corresponding author), NIST, JILA, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",tperkins@jila.colorado.edu,"Walder, Robert/E-9502-2010","Walder, Robert/0000-0002-2904-4539; EDWARDS, DEVIN/0000-0002-2612-9561; Perkins, Thomas/0000-0003-4826-9490","National Research Council; NIH biophysics training grant [T32 GM065103]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI-135398, Phys-1125844]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 AI080709]; Butcher Grant; NISTNational Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) - USA; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1353987] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Biological InfrastructureNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1353987] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI080709, R01AI080709, R01AI080709, R01AI080709, R01AI080709, R01AI080709, R01AI080709] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103, T32GM065103] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by a fellowship from the National Research Council (D.T.E.), an NIH biophysics training grant (M.A.L., T32 GM065103), the National Science Foundation (DBI-135398 to T.T.P.; Phys-1125844), NIH (R01 AI080709 to M.C.S.), a Butcher Grant (to T.T.P.), and NIST.

As a result, experimental and computational methods are being developed, often synergistically, to study the dynamical heterogeneity of a protein or other macromolecules in solution. Thus, methods such as molecular dynamics simulations or ensemble refinement approaches have provided conformational ensembles that can be used to understand protein function and biophysics. These developments have in turn created a need for algorithms and software that can be used to compare structural ensembles in the same way as the root-mean-square-deviation is often used to compare static structures. Although a few such approaches have been proposed, these can be difficult to implement efficiently, hindering a broader applications and further developments. Here, we present an easily accessible software toolkit, called ENCORE, which can be used to compare conformational ensembles generated either from simulations alone or synergistically with experiments. ENCORE implements three previously described methods for ensemble comparison, that each can be used to quantify the similarity between conformational ensembles by estimating the overlap between the probability distributions that underlie them. We demonstrate the kinds of insights that can be obtained by providing examples of three typical use-cases: comparing ensembles generated with different molecular force fields, assessing convergence in molecular simulations, and calculating differences and similarities in structural ensembles refined with various sources of experimental data. We also demonstrate efficient computational scaling for typical analyses, and robustness against both the size and sampling of the ensembles. ENCORE is freely available and extendable, integrates with the established MD Analysis software package, reads ensemble data in many common formats, and can work with large trajectory files.","[Tiberti, Matteo] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Milan, Italy; [Tiberti, Matteo; Papaleo, Elena; Bengtsen, Tone; Boomsma, Wouter; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark","Tiberti, M (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, Milan, Italy.",wb@bio.ku.dk; lindorff@bio.ku.dk,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014; Boomsma, Wouter/K-2903-2014; Papaleo, Elena/M-6629-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039; Boomsma, Wouter/0000-0002-8257-3827; , Elena/0000-0003-2296-898X; Papaleo, Elena/0000-0002-7376-5894; Bengtsen, Tone/0000-0001-8423-2156",Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk Foundation; Villum Foundation; Novo Nordisk FondenNovo Nordisk Foundation [NNF11OC1014446] Funding Source: researchfish; Villum Fonden [00007369] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation (http://www.novonordiskfonden.dk/en) and Villum Foundation (http://villumfonden.dk).

The most popular method to obtain such data is principal component analysis, which extracts modes of large conformational fluctuations around an average structure. We recently applied relaxation mode analysis for protein systems, which approximately estimates the slow relaxation modes and times from a simulation and enables investigations of the dynamic properties underlying the structural fluctuations of proteins. In this study, we apply this relaxation mode analysis to extract reaction coordinates for a system in which there are large conformational changes such as those commonly observed in protein folding/unfolding. We performed a 750-ns simulation of chignolin protein near its folding transition temperature and observed many transitions between the most stable, misfolded, intermediate, and unfolded states. We then applied principal component analysis and relaxation mode analysis to the system. In the relaxation mode analysis, we could automatically extract good reaction coordinates. The free-energy surfaces provide a clearer understanding of the transitions not only between local minimum-energy states but also between the folded and unfolded states, even though the simulation involved large conformational changes. Moreover, we propose a new analysis method called Markov state relaxation mode analysis. We applied the new method to states with slow relaxation, which are defined by the free-energy surface obtained in the relaxation mode analysis. Finally, the relaxation times of the states obtained with a simple Markov state model and the proposed Markov state relaxation mode analysis are compared and discussed.

Non-native contacts can, however, influence folding kinetics by introducing additional local minima that slow diffusion over the global free-energy barrier between folded and unfolded states. Here, we combine single-molecule fluorescence with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to discover the structural origin for the slow diffusion that markedly decreases the folding rate for a designed a-helical protein. Our experimental determination of transition path times and our analysis of the simulations point to non-native salt bridges between helices as the source, which provides a quantitative glimpse of how specific intramolecular interactions influence protein folding rates by altering dynamics and not activation free energies.","[Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Piana-Agostinetti, Stefano; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Chung, HS (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; stefano.piana-agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; david.shaw@DEShawResearch.com; eaton@helix.nih.gov,"Chung, Hoi Sung/C-2624-2009","Chung, Hoi Sung/0000-0001-6897-4969","NIDDKUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank R.

Here, we integrate weak external knowledge into folding simulations to predict protein structures, given their sequence. For example, we instruct the computer to form a hydrophobic core,  to form good secondary structures, or  to seek a compact state. This kind of information has been too combinatoric, nonspecific, and vague to help guide MD simulations before. Within atomistic replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), we develop a statistical mechanical framework, modeling using limited data with coarse physical insight(s) (MELD + CPI), for harnessing weak information. As a test, we apply MELD + CPI to predict the native structures of 20 small proteins. MELD + CPI samples to within less than 3 angstrom from native for all 20 and correctly chooses the native structures (< 4 angstrom) for 15 of them, including ubiquitin, a millisecond folder. MELD + CPI is up to five orders of magnitude faster than brute-force MD, satisfies detailed balance, and should scale well to larger proteins. MELD + CPI may be useful where physics-based simulations are needed to study protein mechanisms and populations and where we have some heuristic or coarse physical knowledge about states of interest.","[Perez, Alberto; Dill, Ken A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [MacCallum, Justin L.] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Dill, Ken A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dill, Ken A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys & Astron, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Perez, A (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",alberto@laufercenter.org; dill@laufercenter.org,"Perez, Alberto/C-5699-2008; Perez, Alberto/R-2599-2016","Perez, Alberto/0000-0002-5054-5338; Perez, Alberto/0000-0002-5054-5338","Laufer Center; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM107104, 5R01GM090205]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [MCB120052]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM090205, R01GM107104, R01GM107104, R01GM090205, R01GM107104, R01GM107104, R01GM090205, R01GM090205, R01GM107104, R01GM107104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank D.

In particular, the global modes of motions (at the low frequency end of the spectrum) are shown by multiple studies to be highly robust to minor differences in the structure or to detailed interactions at the atomic level. These modes, encoded by the overall fold, usually define the mechanisms of interactions with substrates. They can be estimated by low-resolution models such as the elastic network models (ENMs) exclusively based on interresidue contact topology. The ability of ENMs to efficiently assess the global motions intrinsically favored by the overall fold as well as the relevance of these predictions to the dominant changes in structure experimentally observed for a given protein in the presence of different substrates suggest that the intrinsic dynamics plays a role in mediating protein-substrate interactions. These observations underscore the functional significance of structure-encoded dynamics, or the importance of the predisposition to favor functional global modes in the evolutionary selection of structures.","[Bahar, Ivet; Cheng, Mary Hongying; Lee, Ji Young; Kaya, Cihan; Zhang, She] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Bahar, I (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",bahar@pitt.edu,"Bahar, Ivet/AAH-2921-2020","Zhang, She/0000-0001-9265-4498","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 GM099738, P41 GM103712, P30 DA035778]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM099738, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM099738, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM099738, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM099738, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [P30DA035778, P30DA035778, P30DA035778, P30DA035778, P30DA035778] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Support from NIH (grants R01 GM099738, P41 GM103712, and P30 DA035778) is gratefully acknowledged by I.B.",,74,31,31,0,17,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

In this study of the folding of single-chain monellin, it is shown that a kinetic molten globule (MG) is populated at 2 ms of folding. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements show that the kinetic MG is devoid of any helical structure even under the most stabilizing folding conditions. Multisite fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements show that the kinetic MG is compact with different segments having contracted to different extents. It is shown that the sequence segment that goes on to form the sole helix in the native protein is fully collapsed in the kinetic MG. This segment expands to accommodate the helix as the kinetic MG folds further to the native state, while other segments of the protein contract. Helix formation starting from the kinetic MG is shown to occur in multiple kinetic steps, whether measured by far-UV CD or by FRET.","[Goluguri, Rama Reddy; Udgaonkar, Jayant B.] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, India","Udgaonkar, JB (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, India.",jayant@ncbs.res.in,,,"Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchTata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Department of Science and Technology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India); J.

Consequently, knowledge-based potentials often are designed to be efficient in ordering a given set of deformed structures denoted decoys according to how close they are to the relevant native protein structure. This, however, does not necessarily imply that energy minimization of this potential will bring the decoys closer to the native structure. In this study, we introduce an iterative strategy to improve the convergence of decoy structures. It works by adding energy optimized decoys to the pool of decoys used to construct the next and improved knowledge-based potential. We demonstrate that this strategy results in significantly improved decoy convergence on Titan high resolution decoys and refinement targets from Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction competitions.

To investigate the accuracy of molecular simulations of MDM2 and its complex with p53, we performed a number of long (200 ns to 1 mu s) explicit-solvent simulations using a range of force fields. We systematically compared nine popular force fields (AMBER ff03, ff12sb, ff14sb, ff99sb, ff99sb-ildn, ff99sb-ildn-nmr, ff99sb-ildn-phi, CHARMM22*, and CHARMM36) against experimental chemical shift data, and found similarly accurate results, with microsecond simulations achieving better agreement compared to 200-ns trajectories. Although the experimentally determined apo structure has a closed binding cleft, simulations in all force fields suggest the apo state of MDM2 is highly flexible, and able to sample holo-like conformations, consistent with a conformational selection model. Initial structuring of the MDM2 lid region, known to competitively bind the binding cleft, is also observed in long simulations. Taken together, these results show molecular simulations can accurately sample conformations relevant for ligand binding. We expect this study to inform future computational work on folding and binding of MDM2 ligands. Proteins 2015; 83:1665-1676.

Many small molecules have been reported to work in this way, including 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan (NQ-Trp). NQ-Trp has been reported to inhibit aggregation, to rescue cells from A toxicity, and showed complete phenotypic recovery in an in vivo AD model. In this work we investigated its molecular mechanism by using a combined approach of experimental and theoretical studies, and obtained converging results. NQ-Trp is a relatively weak inhibitor and the fluorescence data obtained by employing the fluorophore widely used to monitor aggregation into fibrils can be misinterpreted due to the inner filter effect. Simulations and NMR experiments showed that NQ-Trp has no specific binding site-type interaction with mono- and dimeric A, which could explain its low inhibitory efficiency. This suggests that the reported anti-AD activity of NQ-Trp-type molecules in in vivo models has to involve another mechanism. This study has revealed the potential pitfalls in the development of aggregation inhibitors for amyloidogenic peptides, which are of general interest for all the molecules studied in the context of inhibiting the formation of toxic aggregates.","[Berthoumieu, Olivia; Ferre, Sabrina; Noel, Sabrina; Faller, Peter] CNRS, LCC Lab Chim Coordinat, F-31077 Toulouse 4, France; [Berthoumieu, Olivia; Ferre, Sabrina; Noel, Sabrina; Faller, Peter] Univ Toulouse, INPT, UPS, F-31077 Toulouse 4, France; [Nguyen, Phuong H.; Tarus, Bogdan; Nasica-Labouze, Jessica; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Lab Biochim Theor, Sorbonne Paris Cite,IBPC,UPR 9080, F-75005 Paris, France; [del Castillo-Frias, Maria P.; Doig, Andrew J.] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Saurel, Olivier] Univ Toulouse, UPS, IPBS Inst Pharmacol & Struct Biol, F-31077 Toulouse, France; [Saurel, Olivier] CNRS, IPBS, UMR 5089, F-31077 Toulouse, France; [Rampon, Claire] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Ctr Rech Cognit Anim, UPS, F-31062 Toulouse 4, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France IUF, F-75005 Paris, France","Doig, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, 131 Princess St, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England.",andrew.doig@manchester.ac.uk; philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr; faller@lcc-toulouse.fr,"Olivier, Saurel/AAQ-7007-2020; Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019; Faller, Peter/B-9614-2018; Doig, Andrew/AAD-7456-2019","Faller, Peter/0000-0001-8013-0806; Doig, Andrew/0000-0003-0346-2270","CONACyT (Mexico)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); ANR SIMI7 GRALFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [12-BS07-0011]; European Social Fund, Talents FCG Program; ANR LABEXFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0011]; Foundation Pierre Gilles de Gennes","M.d.C.-F. thanks CONACyT (Mexico) for a Ph.

We simulate the structure-based models of two interleukin-1 cytokines, IL-33 and IL-1 beta, and find that IL-33 has a lower barrier to folding than IL-1 beta We then design the folding motif (FM) of the IL-1 beta-trefoil fold and identify structural deviations of IL-33 and IL-1 beta from this FM. In previous work, we found that structural deviations from the FM that are large enough to lower folding free energy barriers were part of ligand binding sites. In contrast, we find that structural perturbations in IL-33 and IL-1 beta which reduce the folding free energy barrier are located in the folding core and do not bind ligands. In both proteins, such core residues are interleaved with surface residues which are proximal to receptor binding sites. However, IL-33 has a lower folding barrier because its core perturbations are larger than those in IL-1 beta. In order to understand the role of these core perturbations, we perform atomistic simulations of both proteins and find that the larger core perturbations may allow IL-33 to communicate signals differently across the protein. Integrating previous data, we also hypothesize that the larger IL-33 core perturbations may help accommodate its more charged binding site and may also aid in its inactivation by caspase-mediated cleavage. Together, our results suggest that protein folding landscapes are modulated not only by larger functional features such as binding sites but also by the details of protein function and fate. Furthermore, a comparative study of such landscapes may be a facile way to identify subtle differences in allosteric connectivity between two similar proteins.","[Rao, V. V.

The melting temperatures (T-m's), identified with the peaks in the heat capacity curves, decrease as pH decreases, in qualitative agreement with experiments. The calculated radius of gyration, showing dramatic variations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At T-m Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis of the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at T-m with multiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, shows a network of metastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral pH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations resulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal that Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination of nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by which Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural elements responsible for establishing long-range contacts and collapse of Ub. Nucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are marginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes associated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of microseconds, then Ub folding follows the diffusion collision mechanism with intermediates, many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium. Folding at neutral pH is a sequential process with a populated intermediate resembling that sampled at equilibrium. The transition state structures, obtained using a P-fold analysis, are homogeneous and globular with most of the secondary and tertiary structures being native-like. Many of our findings for both the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding are not only in agreement with experiments but also provide missing details not resolvable in standard experiments. The key prediction that folding mechanism varies dramatically with pH is amenable to experimental tests.","[Reddy, Govardhan] Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, Biophys Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Reddy, G (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",greddy@sscu.iisc.ernet.in,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 1361946]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231],"We are indebted to George Makhadatze for pointing out an error in the simulated heat capacity curves in an earlier version.

Here the use of AFM to directly monitor the folding of an alpha/beta protein, NuG2, by using low-drift AFM cantilevers is demonstrated. At slow pulling speeds (< 50 nm s(-1)), the refolding of NuG2 can be clearly observed. Lowering the pulling speed reduces the difference between the unfolding and refolding forces, bringing the non-equilibrium unfolding-refolding reactions towards equilibrium. At very low pulling speeds (ca. 2 nm s(-1)), unfolding and refolding were observed to occur in near equilibrium. Based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem, we then measured the equilibrium free energy change between folded and unfolded states of NuG2. The improved long-term stability of AFM achieved using gold-free cantilevers allows folding-unfolding reactions of alpha/beta proteins to be directly monitored near equilibrium, opening the avenue towards probing the folding reactions of other mechanically important alpha/beta and all-beta elastomeric proteins.","[He, Chengzhi; Xiao, Adam; Li, Hongbin] Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; [Hu, Chunguang; Hu, Xiaodong; Hu, Xiaotang; Li, Hongbin] Tianjin Univ, Sch Precis Instrument & Optoelect Engn, State Key Lab Precis Measurements Technol & Instr, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; NIST, JILA, Boulder, CO USA; [Perkins, Thomas T.] Univ Colorado, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Li, HB (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Chem, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",Hongbin@chem.ubc.ca,"He, Chengzhi/S-3434-2019; Hu, Chunguang/S-5084-2016; Li, Hongbin/G-2949-2012","He, Chengzhi/0000-0001-5013-0207; Hu, Chunguang/0000-0001-6485-904X; Li, Hongbin/0000-0001-7813-1332; Perkins, Thomas/0000-0003-4826-9490","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Canada Chairs Program; Tianjin University; JILA Visiting Fellowship","This work is supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Canada Chairs Program and Tianjin University.

Several model variants are parameterized to test the importance of sequence-specific interactions (approximated by Miyazawa-Jernigan statistical potentials), local structural flexibility (derived from the ensemble of NMR structures), interhelical hydrogen bonds, and native contacts separated by intervening disordered regions (through the Wako-Saito-Munoz-Eaton scheme, which disallows such configurations). The models are optimized by directly simulating experimental observables: CD ellipticity at 222 nm for model proteins and their fragments and C-13-amide I bands for multiple isotopologues of each protein. We find that data can be quantitatively reproduced by the model that allows two interacting segments flanking a disordered loop (double sequence approximation) and incorporates flexibility in the native contact maps, but neither sequence-specific interactions nor hydrogen bonds are required. The near-identical free energy profiles as a function of the global order parameter are consistent with expected similar folding kinetics for nearly identical structures. However, the predicted folding mechanism for the two motifs is different, reflecting the order of local stability. We introduce free energy profiles for experimental reaction coordinates-namely, the degree of local folding as sensed by site-specific C-13-edited IR, which highlight folding heterogeneity and contrast its overall, average description with the detailed, local picture.","[Lai, Jason K.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Mol Biol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Kubelka, Ginka S.; Kubelka, Jan] Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Kubelka, J (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jkubelka@uwyo.edu,,,National Science Foundation CAREER GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0846140],We thank Milan Balaz for the use of circular dichroism and high performance liquid chromatography instruments and William A.

Recent advances in electron microscopy and solid state NMR have allowed the characterization of fibril structures to different extents of refinement. However, structural details about the mechanism of fibril formation remain relatively poorly defined. This is mainly due to the complex, heterogeneous and transient nature of the species responsible for assembly; properties that make them difficult to detect and characterize in structural detail using biophysical techniques. The ability of solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate exchange between multiple protein states, to characterize transient and low-population species, and to study high molecular weight assemblies, render NMR an invaluable technique for studies of amyloid assembly. In this article we review state-of-the-art solution NMR methods for investigations of: (a) protein dynamics that lead to the formation of aggregation-prone species; (b) amyloidogenic intrinsically disordered proteins; and (c) protein-protein interactions on pathway to fibril formation. Together, these topics highlight the power and potential of NMR to provide atomic level information about the molecular mechanisms of one of the most fascinating problems in structural biology.

In comparison with hundred-of-microsecond timescale conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed on the Anton supercomputer, aMD captured complete folding of the four proteins in significantly shorter simulation time. The folded protein conformations were found within 0.2-2.1 angstrom of the native NMR or X-ray crystal structures. Free energy profiles calculated through improved reweighting of the aMD simulations using cumulant expansion to the second-order are in good agreement with those obtained from cMD simulations. This allows us to identify distinct conformational states (e.g., unfolded and intermediate) other than the native structure and the protein folding energy barriers. Detailed analysis of protein secondary structures and local key residue interactions provided important insights into the protein folding pathways. Furthermore, the selections of force fields and aMD simulation parameters are discussed in detail. Our work shows usefulness and accuracy of aMD in studying protein folding, providing basic references in using aMD in future protein-folding studies.

If the unfolded state space is discretized, we can evaluate the relaxation time of each state. We derive a simple relation that shows the mean first passage time to any state is equal to the relaxation time of that state divided by the equilibrium population. This explains why mean first passage times from state to state within the unfolded ensemble can be very long but the energy landscape can still be smooth (minimally frustrated). In fact, when the folding kinetics is two-state, all of the unfolded state relaxation times within the unfolded free energy basin are faster than the folding time. This result supports the well-established funnel energy landscape picture and resolves an apparent contradiction between this model and the recently proposed kinetic hub model of protein folding. We validate these concepts by analyzing a Markov state model of the kinetics in the unfolded state and folding of the miniprotein NTL9 (where NTL9 is the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9), constructed from a 2.9 ms simulation provided by D.

While the first issue can be addressed by employing enhanced sampling techniques such as simulated tempering or replica exchange molecular dynamics, repeating these simulations with different force fields is very time consuming. Here, we propose an automatic method that includes different force fields into a single advanced sampling simulation. Conformational sampling using three all-atom force fields is enhanced by simulated tempering and by formulating the weight parameters of the simulated tempering method in terms of the energy fluctuations, the system is able to perform random walk in both temperature and force field spaces. The method is first demonstrated on a 1D system and then validated by the folding of the 10-residue chignolin peptide in explicit water.

The following results are particularly striking. (1) Two well-defined structural regimes, one at x(EtOH) similar to 0.05 and the other at x(EtOH) similar to 0.25, characterized by formation of distinct partially folded conformations and separated by a unique partially unfolded intermediate state at x(EtOH) similar to 0.15, are identified. (2) Existence of non-monotonic composition dependence of (i) radius of gyration, (ii) long range contact order, (iii) residue specific solvent accessible surface area of tryptophan, and (iv) circular dichroism spectra and UV-absorption peaks are observed. Interestingly at x(EtOH) similar to 0.15, time averaged value of the contact order parameter of the protein reaches a minimum, implying that this conformational state can be identified as a molten globule state. Multiple structural transformations well known in water-ethanol binary mixture appear to have considerably stronger effects on conformation and dynamics of the protein. We compare the present results with studies in water-dimethyl sulfoxide mixture where also distinct structural transformations are observed along with variation of co-solvent composition.

This general observation underestimates the importance of alpha-helical segments in the aggregation cascade. Here, using a Combination of experimental techniques and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the aggregation of a 43-residue, apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide and its E21Q and D26N mutants. Our study indicates a strong propensity of helical segments not to adopt cross-beta-fibrils. The helix-turn-helix monomeric conformation of the peptides is preserved in the mature fibrils. Furthermore, we reveal opposite effects of mutations On and near the turn region in the self-assembly of these peptides. We show that the E21-R24 salt bridge is a major contributor to helix-turn-helix folding, subsequently leading to abundant fibril formation. On the other hand, the K19-D26 interaction is not required to fold the native helix-turn-helix peptide. However, removal of the charged D26 residue decreases the stability of the helix-turn-helix monomer and consequently reduces the level of aggregation. Finally, we provide a more refined assembly model for the helix-turn-helix peptides from apolipoprotein A-I based on the parallel stacking of helix-turn-helix dimers.","[Do, Thanh D.; Chamas, Ali; Zheng, Xueyun; Shea, Joan-Emma; Bowers, Michael T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Shea, Joan-Emma] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Barnes, Aaron; Chang, Dayna; Veldstra, Tjitske; Takhar, Harmeet; Dressler, Nicolette; Trapp, Benjamin; Miller, Kylie; McMahon, Audrene; Cantrell, Kristi Lazar] Westmont Coll, Dept Chem, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA; [Meredith, Stephen C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Pathol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Meredith, Stephen C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Cantrell, KL (corresponding author), Westmont Coll, Dept Chem, Santa Barbara, CA 93108 USA.",klazar@westmont.edu; bowers@chem.ucsb.edu,"Do, Thanh/D-5170-2017","Do, Thanh/0000-0002-1978-4365; Chamas, Ali/0000-0001-8739-8880; Zheng, Xueyun/0000-0001-9782-4521","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1301032, MCB-1158577]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1RO1AG047116- 01]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Westmont Provost's Office; Allan Nishimura Summer Research Fund; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-1053575]; XSEDE Grant [TG-MCA05S027]; Center for Scientific Computing at the CNSI via NSF MRSEC [DMR-1121053]; Center for Scientific Computing at the MRL via NSF MRSEC [DMR-1121053]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-0960316]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R01AG047116, R01AG047116, R01AG047116, R01AG047116] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1301032] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We gratefully acknowledge support from National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants CHE-1301032 (M.T.B.) and MCB-1158577 (J.-E.S.), National Institutes of Health Grant 1RO1AG047116- 01 (M.T.B.), the David and Lucile Packard Foundation (J.-E.S.), the Westmont Provost's Office for summer research funding (A.B., D.C., T.V., H.T., N.D., and B.T.), and the Allan Nishimura Summer Research Fund (K.L.C.).

However, our recent work on Protein L finds that its TSE contains both hairpins, compelling a reassessment of the influence of sequence on the folding behavior of the other two homologs. We characterize the TSEs for Protein G and NuG2b, a triple mutant of NuG2, using. analysis, a method for identifying contacts in the TSE. All three homologs are found to share a common and near-native TSE topology with interactions between all four strands. However, the helical content varies in the TSE, being largely absent in Proteins G & L but partially present in NuG2b. The variability likely arises from competing propensities for the formation of nonnative beta turns in the naturally occurring proteins, as observed in our TerItFix folding algorithm. All-atom folding simulations of NuG2b recapitulate the observed TSEs with four strands for 5 of 27 transition paths [Lindorff-Larsen K, Piana S, Dror RO, Shaw DE (2011) Science 334 (6055):517-520]. Our data support the view that homologous proteins have similar folding mechanisms, even when nonnative interactions are present in the transition state. These findings emphasize the ongoing challenge of accurately characterizing and predicting TSEs, even for relatively simple proteins.","[Baxa, Michael C.; Yu, Wookyung; Adhikari, Aashish N.; Ge, Liang; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Baxa, Michael C.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yu, Wookyung] Daegu Gyeongbuk Inst Sci & Technol DGIST, Ctr Proteome Biophys, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Daegu 711873, South Korea; [Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Xia, Zhen; Zhou, Ruhong] IBM Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Computat Biol Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA; [Xia, Zhen; Zhou, Ruhong] Soochow Univ, Inst Quantitat Biol & Med, Sch Radiat Med & Protect, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Xia, Zhen; Zhou, Ruhong] Soochow Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Radiat Med Jiangsu Higher, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Freed, Karl F.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Freed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",freed@uchicago.edu; trsosnic@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599; Yu, Wookyung/0000-0001-9835-930X; Zhou, Ruhong/0000-0001-8624-5591","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM055694]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1363012]; National Creative Research Initiatives (Center for Proteome Biophysics) of National Research Foundation, Korea [2011-0000041]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank S.

Due to its major role in HIV-1 pathogenicity, Nef protein is considered an emerging target in anti-HIV drug design and discovery process. In this study, comparative long-range all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were employed for apo and bound protein to unveil molecular mechanism of HIV-Nef dimerization and inhibition. Results clearly revealed that B9, a newly discovered Nef inhibitor, binds at the dimeric interface of Nef protein and caused significant separation between orthogonally opposed residues, namely Asp108, Leu112 and Gln104. Large differences in magnitudes were observed in the radius of gyration (approximate to 1.5 angstrom), per-residue fluctuation (approximate to 2 angstrom), C-alpha deviations (approximate to 2 angstrom) which confirm a comparatively more flexible nature of apo conformation due to rapid dimeric association. Compared to the bound conformer, a more globally correlated motion in case of apo structure of HIV-Nef confirms the process of dimeric association. This clearly highlights the process of inhibition as a result of ligand binding. The difference in principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plot and per-residue mobility plot across first two normal modes further justifies the same findings. The in-depth dynamic analyses of Nef protein presented in this report would serve crucial in understanding its function and inhibition mechanisms. Information on inhibitor binding mode would also assist in designing of potential inhibitors against this important HIV target.","[Moonsamy, Suri; Bhakat, Soumendranath; Soliman, Mahmoud E.

Single-molecule spectroscopy, combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer, is utilized to study the conformational heterogeneity and the state-to-state transition dynamics of proteins on the submillisecond to second timescales. However, observation of the dynamics on the microsecond timescale is still very challenging. This timescale is important because the elementary processes of protein dynamics take place and direct comparison between experiment and simulation is possible. Here we report a new single-molecule technique to reveal the microsecond structural dynamics of proteins through correlation of the fluorescence lifetime. This method, two-dimensional fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy, is applied to clarify the conformational dynamics of cytochrome c. Three conformational ensembles and the microsecond transitions in each ensemble are indicated from the correlation signal, demonstrating the importance of quantifying microsecond dynamics of proteins on the folding free energy landscape.","[Otosu, Takuhiro; Ishii, Kunihiko; Tahara, Tahei] RIKEN, Mol Spect Lab, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ishii, Kunihiko; Tahara, Tahei] RIKEN, Ctr Adv Photon RAP, Ultrafast Spect Res Team, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan","Tahara, T (corresponding author), RIKEN, Mol Spect Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",tahei@riken.jp,"Tahara, Tahei/I-5714-2014","Tahara, Tahei/0000-0002-6340-8535","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [23107732, 25104005]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25104005, 15K17814] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to the Support Unit for Bio-Material Analysis, RIKEN BSI Research Resources Center, for technical help with purification of cytochrome c.

New Fourier coefficients for the dihedral angle terms of the OPLS-AA force field were fit to these surfaces, utilizing a Boltzmann-weighted error function and systematically examining the effects of weighting temperature. To prevent overfitting to the available data, a minimal number of new residue-specific and peptide-specific torsion terms were developed. Extensive experimental solution-phase and quantum chemical gas-phase benchmarks were used to assess the quality of the new parameters, named OPLS-AA/M, demonstrating significant improvement over previous OPLS-AA force fields. A Boltzmann weighting temperature of 2000 K was determined to be optimal for fitting the new Fourier coefficients for dihedral angle parameters.

We enhance the structural resolution of the five-helix bundle protein lambda(6-85) by engineering into it three fluorescent tryptophan-tyrosine contact probes. The probes report on distances between three different helix pairs: 1-2, 1-3, and 3-2. Temperature jump relaxation experiments on these three mutants reveal two different kinetic timescales: a slower timescale for 1-3 and a faster one for the two contacts involving helix 2. We hypothesize that these differences arise from a single folding mechanism that forms contacts on different timescales, and not from changes of mechanism due to adding the probes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the corresponding three distances in one published single-trajectory all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation of a similar mutant. Autocorrelation analysis of the trajectory reveals the same slow and fast distance change as does experiment, but on a faster timescale; smoothing the trajectory in time shows that this ordering is robust and persists into the microsecond folding timescale. Structural investigation of the all-atom computational data suggests that helix 2 misfolds to produce a short-lived off-pathway trap, in agreement with the experimental finding that the 1-2 and 3-2 distances involving helix 2 contacts form a kinetic grouping distinct from 1 to 3. Our work demonstrates that comparison between experiment and simulation can be extended to several order parameters, providing a stronger mechanistic test.","[Prigozhin, Maxim B.; Sukenik, Shahar; Pogorelov, Taras V.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chao, Shu-Han; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pogorelov, Taras V.] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Pogorelov, TV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",pogorelo@illinois.edu; mgruebel@illinois.edu,"Pogorelov, Taras/AAH-8587-2020; Sukenik, Shahar/J-4438-2013","Pogorelov, Taras/0000-0001-5851-7721; Sukenik, Shahar/0000-0003-3855-9574","Illinois Campus Research Board; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment [TG-MCB130112]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1053575]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [2R01 GM093318-04]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank D.

A growing number of time series datasets, however, involve many observables, often with the property that a given change typically affects only a few of the observables. We introduce a general statistical method that, given many noisy observables, detects points in time at which various subsets of the observables exhibit simultaneous changes in data distribution and explicitly identifies those subsets. Our work is motivated by the problem of identifying the nature and timing of biologically interesting conformational changes that occur during atomic-level simulations of biomolecules such as proteins. This problem has proved challenging both because each such conformational change might involve only a small region of the molecule and because these changes are often subtle relative to the ever-present background of faster structural fluctuations. We show that our method is effective in detecting biologically interesting conformational changes in molecular dynamics simulations of both folded and unfolded proteins, even in cases where these changes are difficult to detect using alternative techniques. This method may also facilitate the detection of change points in other types of sequential data involving large numbers of observables-a problem likely to become increasingly important as such data continue to proliferate in a variety of application domains.","[Fan, Zhou; Dror, Ron O.; Mildorf, Thomas J.; Piana, Stefano; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Cellular & Mol Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Ron.Dror@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,,,,38,17,18,0,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

For efficiency and reliability, we also performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the alanine di- and decapeptide, and the dimer of the A beta 16-22 Alzheimer's fragment, and used experimental data and previous simulation results on the chignolin, beta3s, Trp-cage, and WW domain peptides of 10-37 amino acids. The sampling with ST is found to be more efficient than with REMD for a much lower CPU cost. Starting from: unfolded Or extended conformations, the WW domain and the Trp-cage peptide fold to their NMR structures with a backbone RMSD of 2.0 and 1 angstrom. Remarkably, the ST simulation explores transient non-native topologies for Trp-cage that have been rarely discussed by other simulations. Our ST simulations also show that the CHARMM22* force field has limitations in describing accurately the beta3s peptide. Taken together, these results open the door to the study of the configurations of single proteins, protein aggregates, and any molecular systems at atomic details in explicit solvent using a single normal CPU. They also demonstrate that our ST scheme can be used with any force field ranging from quantum mechanics to coarse-grain and atomistic.","[Zhang, Tong; Nguyen, Phuong H.; Nasica-Labouze, Jessica; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris 07, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UPR CNRS 9080, Lab Biochim Theor,IBPC, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zhang, Tong; Mu, Yuguang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Singapore 637551, Singapore; [Nasica-Labouze, Jessica] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, I-34126 Trieste, Italy; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris 07, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UPR CNRS 9080, Lab Biochim Theor,IBPC, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019","Zhang, Tong/0000-0003-1011-5189; Zhang, Tong/0000-0002-2046-4502",GRAL ANR SIMIFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [12-BS07-0017-01]; Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation; DYNAMO [ANR-11-LABX-0011],This work was supported by grants from the GRAL ANR SIMI 12-BS07-0017-01 and Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation.

The fast phase shows differences between perturbation methods and is Closer to the downhill limit by temperature jump, but closer to the transiently populated intermediate limit by pressure jump. These observations, make more demands on simulations of the folding process than just a rough comparison of time scales. To complement experiments, we carried out several pressure jump and temperature jump all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories in explicit solvent, where FiP35 folded in five of the six simulations. We analyzed our pressure rump simulations by kinetic modeling and found that the pressure jump experiments and MD simulations are most consistent with a 4-state kinetic mechanism.

However, FEL of native proteins is usually projected onto one or a few dimensions. Here we generated collectively 0.2 milli-second molecular dynamics simulation trajectories in explicit solvent for hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), and carried out detailed conformational analysis based on backbone torsional degrees of freedom (DOF). Our results demonstrated that at micro-second and coarser temporal resolutions, FEL of HEWL exhibits hub-like topology with crystal structures occupying the dominant structural ensemble that serves as the hub of conformational transitions. However, at 100ns and finer temporal resolutions, conformational substates of HEWL exhibit network-like topology, crystal structures are associated with kinetic traps that are important but not dominant ensembles. Backbone torsional state transitions on time scales ranging from nanoseconds to beyond microseconds were found to be associated with various types of molecular interactions. Even at nanoseconds temporal resolution, the number of conformational substates that are of statistical significance is quite limited. These observations suggest that detailed analysis of conformational substates at multiple temporal resolutions is both important and feasible. Transition state ensembles among various conformational substates at microsecond temporal resolution were observed to be considerably disordered. Life times of these transition state ensembles are found to be nearly independent of the time scales of the participating torsional DOFs.","[Wang, Kai; Long, Shiyang; Tian, Pu] Jilin Univ, Sch Life Sci, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China; [Tian, Pu] Jilin Univ, MOE Key Lab Mol Enzymol & Engn, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China","Tian, P (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Sch Life Sci, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China.",tianpu@jlu.edu.cn,,,"Jilin UniversityJilin University; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31270758]; High Performance Computing Center of Jilin University, China","This research was partially funded by a start-up fund from Jilin University and by 481 National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 31270758. 482 Computational resources were partially supported by High Performance Computing 483 Center of Jilin University, China.

A percolation phase transition occurs when, as edges are added to a network, its largest connected cluster abruptly jumps from insignificance to complete dominance. In this article, we apply percolation theory to meticulously constructed networks of protein folding dynamics called Markov state models. As rare fluctuations are systematically repressed (or reintroduced), we observe percolation-like phase transitions in protein folding networks: whole sets of conformational states switch from nearly complete isolation to complete connectivity in a rapid fashion. We analyze the general and critical properties of these phase transitions in seven protein systems and discuss how closely dynamics on protein folding landscapes relate to percolation on random lattices.

We describe a method called Modeling Employing Limited Data (MELD) that can harness such problematic information in a physics-based, Bayesian framework for improved structure determination. We apply MELD to eight proteins of known structure for which such problematic structural data are available, including a sparse NMR dataset, two ambiguous EPR datasets, and four uncertain datasets taken from sequence evolution data.

Here we present force-field parameters for one of the most common pairs of chromophores used in experiments, AlexaFluor 488 and 594. From microsecond molecular-dynamics simulations, we are able to recover both experimentally determined equilibrium constants and association/dissociation rates of the chromophores with free tryptophan, as well as the decay of fluorescence anisotropy of a labeled protein. We find that it is particularly important to obtain a correct balance of solute-water interactions in the simulations in order to faithfully capture the experimental anisotropy decays, which provide a sensitive benchmark for fluorophore mobility. Lastly, by a combination of experiment and simulation, we address a potential complication in the interpretation of experiments on polyproline, used as a molecular ruler for FRET experiments, namely the potential association of one of the chromophores with the polyproline helix. Under conditions where simulations accurately capture the fluorescence anisotropy decay, we find at most a modest, transient population of conformations in which the chromophores associate with the polyproline. Explicit calculation of FRET transfer efficiencies for short polyprolines yields results in good agreement with experiment. These results illustrate the potential power of a combination of molecular simulation and experiment in quantifying biomolecular dynamics.","[Best, Robert B.] Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Hofmann, Hagen; Nettels, Daniel; Schuler, Benjamin] Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, Zurich, Switzerland","Best, RB (corresponding author), Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov; schuler@bioc.uzh.ch,"Hofmann, Hagen/L-5735-2013; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Schuler, Benjamin/E-7342-2011","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; Schuler, Benjamin/0000-0002-5970-4251","Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",R.B. was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.

In this Article, We present a, general scheme that harnesses the power of Markov state models (MSMs) to extract equilibrium kinetic properties from molecular dynamics trajectories collected on biased potential energy surfaces. We first validate our reweighting protocol on a simple two-well potential, and we proceed to test our method on potential-biased simulations of the Trp-cage miniprotein. In both cases, we find that equilibrium populations, time scales, and dynamical processes are reliably reproduced as compared to gold standard; unbiased data sets.

From molecular simulations of GB1 hairpin, trpzip4, trpzip5, and trpzip6 performed on Folding@home, Markov State Models (MSMs) were constructed using a unified set of metastable states, enabling objective comparison of folding mechanisms. MSM models display quantitative agreement with experimental structural observables and folding kinetics, and predict multimodal kinetics due to specific non-native kinetic traps, which be identified as on-or off-pathway from the network topology. We quantify kinetic frustration by several means, including the s-ensemble method to evaluate glasslike behavior. Free-energy profiles and transition state movement clearly show stabilization of non-native states as Trp mutations are introduced. Remarkably, we find that beta-capped sequences (trpzip4 and trpzip5) are able to overcome this frustration and remain cooperative two-state folders with a large time-scale gap. These results suggest that, while beta-capping motifs are robust, fold stabilization by tryptophan generally may require overcoming significant non-native kinetic traps, perhaps explaining their under-representation in natural proteins.","[Razavi, Asghar M.; Voelz, Vincent A.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Voelz, VA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",voelz@temple.edu,,"Voelz, Vincent/0000-0002-1054-2124","National Science Foundation, through Major Research Instrumentation Grant [CNS-09-58854]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1412508]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412508] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412508] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, through Major Research Instrumentation Grant No. CNS-09-58854, and through NSF MCB-1412508.

We study the interactions of OmpF with pentamerc poly-nucleotides (poly-Ns) in silico. The poly-N molecule is forced to translocate through the lumen of OmpF. Subsequently, the structural and dynamical effects of translocation steps on protein and poly-N molecules are explored in detail. The external loops of OmpF are introduced as the main region for discrimination of poly-Ns based on their organic bases. Structural network analyses of OmpF in the presence or absence of poly-Ns characterize special residues in the structural network of porin. These residues pave the way for engineering OmpF protein. The poly-N-specific pattern of OmpF's local conductance is detected in the current study. Computing the potential of mean force for translocation steps, we define the energetic barrier ahead of poly-N to move through OmpF's lumen. We suggest that fast translocation of the examined poly-N molecules through OmpF seems unattainable by small external driving forces. Our computational results suggest some abilities for OmpF porin like OmpF's potential for being used in poly-N sequencing.","[Hadi-Alijanvand, Hamid; Rouhani, Maryam] IASBS, Dept Biol Sci, Zanjan 4513766731, Iran","Hadi-Alijanvand, H (corresponding author), IASBS, Dept Biol Sci, Zanjan 4513766731, Iran.",hhadi@iasbs.ac.ir,"Hadi-Alijanvand, Hamid/AAE-3921-2020","Hadi-Alijanvand, Hamid/0000-0001-8289-2214","Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) at Zanjan, Iran","Authors acknowledge the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) at Zanjan, Iran, for supporting this work.",,96,0,0,1,15,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

In the last two decades, by combining the molecular simulations with experiments, a number of key features of structure and dynamics of biomolecules have been revealed. Traditional molecular simulations often use the all-atom model or some coarse grained models. In practical applications, however, these all-atom models and coarse grained models encounter the bottlenecks in accuracy and efficiency, respectively, which hinder their applications to some extent. In recent years, the multiscale models have attracted much attention in the field of biomolecule simulations. In the multiscale model, the atomistic models and coarse grained models are combined together based on the principle of statistical physics, and thus the bottlenecks encountered in the traditional models can be overcome. The currently available multiscale models can be classified into four categories according to the coupling ways between the all-atom model and coarse gained model. They are 1) hybrid resolution multiscale model, 2) parallel coupling multiscale model, 3) one-way coupling multiscale model, and 4) self-learning multiscale model. All these multiscale strategies have achieved great success in certain aspects in the field of biomolecule simulations, including protein folding, aggregation, and functional motions of many kinds of protein machineries. In this review, we briefly introduce the above-mentioned four multiscale strategies, and the examples of their applications. We also discuss the limitations and advantages, as well as the application scopes of these multiscale methods. The directions for future work on improving these multiscale models are also suggested. Finally, a summary and some prospects are presented.","[Li Wen-Fei] Nanjing Univ, Dept Phys, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Li, WF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Dept Phys, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wfli@nju.edu.cn; wangwei@nju.edu.cn,"Li, Wenfei/A-1814-2011; Zhang, Jian/A-5886-2017","Li, Wenfei/0000-0003-2679-4075; Zhang, Jian/0000-0003-2338-0395","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11174134, 11334004, 11274157, 11174133]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2011546]","Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11174134, 11334004, 11274157, 11174133), and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK2011546).",,70,3,4,0,35,CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC,BEIJING,"P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3290,,,ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED,Acta Phys.

Droplet-like restraints are necessary to keep multichain systems together and prevent them from dissolving to infinitely low concentration. As an alternative for droplet-like restrains cuboid PBCs with imaging of the molecules were introduced. Owing to this modification, artificial forces which arose from restraints keeping a droplet together were eliminated what leads to more realistic trajectories. Due to computational reasons cutoff and smoothing functions were introduced on the long range interactions. The UNRES force field with PBC was tested by performing microcanonical simulations. Moreover, to asses the behavior of the thermostat in PBCs Langevin and Berendsen thermostats were studied. The influence of PBCs on association pattern was compared with droplet-like restraints on the hetero tetramer 1 protein system.

PfA functions as a homodimer, with each monomer made of distinct N- and C-terminal domains. The purified individual domains as well as single Trp mutant of each domain were subjected to chemical denaturation/renaturation and probed by combination of spectroscopic, chromatographic, quenching and scattering techniques. We found that the N-domain acts like a folding scaffold and assists the folding of remaining polypeptide. The domains displayed sequential folding with the N-domain having higher thermodynamic stability. We report that the extreme thermal stability of PfA is due to the presence of high intersubunit associative forces supported by extensive H-bonding and ionic interactions network. Our results proved that folding cooperativity in a thermophilic, multisubunit protein is dictated by concomitant folding and association of constituent domains directly into a native quaternary structure. This report gives an account of the factors responsible for folding and stability of a therapeutically and industrially important protein.","[Garg, Dushyant K.; Tomar, Rachana; Srivastava, Ankit; Kundu, Bishwajit] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Kusuma Sch Biol Sci, New Delhi 110016, India; [Dhoke, Reema R.] Inst Microbial Technol Chandigarh, CSIR, Chandigarh, India","Kundu, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Kusuma Sch Biol Sci, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 110016, India.",bkundu@bioschool.iitd.ac.in,,"Garg, Dushyant K/0000-0001-5985-0358; Kundu, Bishwajit/0000-0002-5786-3144",CSIR-INDIACouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; ICMR Govt. of INDIAIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); IIT Delhi,DKG and RT acknowledge CSIR-INDIA and AS acknowledges ICMR Govt. of INDIA for their Research Fellowship.

Scope of review: As one of the main factors limiting the accuracy of MD results is the empirical force field used, the present paper offers a review of recent developments in the CHARMM additive force field, one of the most popular biomolecular force fields. Additionally, we present a detailed discussion of the CHARMM Drude polarizable force field, anticipating a growth in the importance and utilization of polarizable force fields in the near future. Throughout the discussion emphasis is placed on the force fields' parametrization philosophy and methodology. Major conclusions: Recent improvements in the CHARMM additive force field are mostly related to newly found weaknesses in the previous generation of additive force fields. Beyond the additive approximation is the newly available CHARMM Drude polarizable force field, which allows for MD simulations of up to 1 mu s on proteins, DNA, lipids and carbohydrates. General significance: Addressing the limitations ensures the reliability of the new CHARMM36 additive force field for the types of calculations that are presently coming into routine computational reach while the availability of the Drude polarizable force fields offers an inherently more accurate model of the underlying physical forces driving macromolecular structures and dynamics.

Experimentally, at pH 7.0 and 10 degrees C, Im7 folds in a three-state manner via an intermediate but Im9 folding is two-state-like. Accordingly, Im7 exhibits a chevron rollover, whereas the chevron arm for Im9 folding is linear. Here we address the biophysical basis of their different behaviors by using native-centric models with and without additional transferrable, sequence-dependent energies. The Im7 chevron rollover is not captured by either a pure native-centric model or a model augmented by nonnative hydrophobic interactions with a uniform strength irrespective of residue type. By contrast, a more realistic nonnative interaction scheme that accounts for the difference in hydrophobicity among residues leads simultaneously to a chevron rollover for Im7 and an essentially linear folding chevron arm for Im9. Hydrophobic residues identified by published experiments to be involved in nonnative interactions during Im7 folding are found to participate in the strongest nonnative contacts in this model. Thus our observations support the experimental perspective that the Im7 folding intermediate is largely underpinned by nonnative interactions involving large hydrophobics. Our simulation suggests further that nonnative effects in Im7 are facilitated by a lower local native contact density relative to that of Im9. In a one-dimensional diffusion picture of Im7 folding with a coordinate-and stability-dependent diffusion coefficient, a significant chevron rollover is consistent with a diffusion coefficient that depends strongly on native stability at the conformational position of the folding intermediate.","[Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chen, Tao; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Chen, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,,,Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-84281],"The authors received the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Grant No. MOP-84281 (http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/).

Ambiguity pervades simulations of these complex systems because there is no prior knowledge of relevant phase space domains, and sampling recurrence is difficult to achieve. In molecular dynamics methods, ruggedness of the free energy surface exacerbates this problem by slowing down the unbiased exploration of phase space. Sampling is inefficient if dwell times in metastable states are large. Methods: We suggest a heuristic algorithm to terminate and reseed trajectories run in multiple copies in parallel. It uses a recent method to order snapshots, which provides notions of interesting and unique for individual simulations. We define criteria to guide the reseeding of runs from more interesting points if they sample overlapping regions of phase space. Results: Using a pedagogical example and an ct-helical peptide, the approach is demonstrated to amplify the rate of exploration of phase space and to discover metastable states not found by conventional sampling schemes. Evidence is provided that accurate kinetics and pathways can be extracted from the simulations. Conclusions: The method, termed PIGS for Progress Index Guided Sampling, proceeds in unsupervised fashion, is scalable, and benefits synergistically from larger numbers of replicas. Results confirm that the underlying ideas are appropriate and sufficient to enhance sampling. General Significance: In molecular simulations, errors caused by not exploring relevant domains in phase space are always unquantifiable and can be arbitrarily large. Our protocol adds to the toollcit available to researchers in reducing these types of errors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Recent Developments of Molecular Dynamics.

Knowledge of the preferred hydration sites at biomolecular interfaces and those in the interior of cavities can enhance understanding of structure and function. While advanced X-ray diffraction methods can provide accurate atomic structures for proteins, that technique is challenged when it comes to providing accurate hydration structures, especially for interfacial and cavity bound solvent molecules. Methods: Advances in integral equation theories which include more accurate methods for calculating the long-ranged Coulomb interaction contributions to the three-dimensional distribution functions make it possible to calculate angle dependent average solvent structure, accurately, around and inside irregular molecular conformations. The proximal radial distribution method provides another approximate method to determine average solvent structures for biomolecular systems based on a proximal or near neighbor solvent distribution that can be constructed from previously collected solvent distributions. These two approximate methods, along with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine the solvent density inside the myoglobin heme cavity. Discussion and results: Myoglobin is a good test system for these methods because the cavities are many and one is large, tens of angstrom(3), but is shown to have only four hydration sites. These sites are not near neighbors which implies that the large cavity must have more than one way in and out Conclusions: Our results show that main solvation sites are well reproduced by all three methods. The techniques also produce a clearly identifiable solvent pathway into the interior of the protein.

When homologous structures are not available, fragment-based protein structure prediction has become the approach of choice. However, it still has many issues including poor performance when targets' lengths are above 100 residues, excessive running times and sub-optimal energy functions. Taking advantage of the reliable performance of structural class prediction software, we propose to address some of the limitations of fragment-based methods by integrating structural constraints in their fragment selection process. Results: Using Rosetta, a state-of-the-art fragment-based protein structure prediction package, we evaluated our proposed pipeline on 70 former CASP targets containing up to 150 amino acids. Using either CATH or SCOP-based structural class annotations, enhancement of structure prediction performance is highly significant in terms of both GDT_TS (at least + 2.6, p-values < 0.0005) and RMSD (-0.4, p-values < 0.005). Although CATH and SCOP classifications are different, they perform similarly. Moreover, proteins from all structural classes benefit from the proposed methodology. Further analysis also shows that methods relying on class-based fragments produce conformations which are more relevant to user and converge quicker towards the best model as estimated by GDT_TS (up to 10% in average). This substantiates our hypothesis that usage of structurally relevant templates conducts to not only reducing the size of the conformation space to be explored, but also focusing on a more relevant area. Conclusions: Since our methodology produces models the quality of which is up to 7% higher in average than those generated by a standard fragment-based predictor, we believe it should be considered before conducting any fragment-based protein structure prediction. Despite such progress, ab initio prediction remains a challenging task, especially for proteins of average and large sizes. Apart from improving search strategies and energy functions, integration of additional constraints seems a promising route, especially if they can be accurately predicted from sequence alone.","[Abbass, Jad; Nebel, Jean-Christophe] Univ Kingston, Fac Sci Engn & Comp, London KT1 2EE, England","Abbass, J (corresponding author), Univ Kingston, Fac Sci Engn & Comp, London KT1 2EE, England.",k1064285@kingston.ac.uk,"Abbass, Jad/D-4399-2018; Nebel, Jean-Christophe/B-5655-2009","Abbass, Jad/0000-0002-3491-8237; Nebel, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-1812-5269",Polish National Centre for Science [6435/B/T02/2011/40],"We would like to thank the IT department at Faculty of Science, Engineering and Computing at Kingston University namely Adams Hobs and Colin Macliesh for their support in using the Kingston University High Performance Cluster (KUHPC).

It is commonly thought that amide backbone protection arises from intramolecular H-bonding and/or burial of NH sites. Recently, fundamental HDX-related tenets have been called into question. The current work focuses on ubiquitin for exploring the defining features that distinguish amides in open (exchange-competent) and closed (exchange-incompetent) environments. Instead of relying on static X-ray structures, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for obtaining a dynamic view of the protein ground state and its surrounding solvent. The HDX properties for 57 out of 72 NH sites can be readily explained on the basis of backbone and side chain H-bonding, as well as solvent accessibility considerations. Unexpectedly, the same criteria fail for predicting the HDX characteristics of the remaining 15 amides. Significant protection is seen for numerous exposed NH sites that are not engaged in intramolecular H-bonds, whereas other amides that seemingly share the same features are unprotected. We scrutinize the proposal that H-bonding to crystallographically defined water can cause the protection of surface amides. For ubiquitin, the positioning of crystal water is not compatible with this idea. To further explore possible solvation effects, we tested for the presence of partially immobilized water networks. Our MD data reveal no difference in the solvation properties of protected vs unprotected surface amides, making it unlikely that restricted water dynamics can cause anomalous amide protection. The findings reported here suggest that efforts to deduce protein structural features on the basis of HDX protection factors may yield misleading results. This conclusion is relevant for initiatives that rely on sparse structural data as constraints for elucidating protein conformations.

PIC consists of the three parts: an aromatic linker, a diarylimidazole moiety, and a 4H-cyclohexadienone ring. Upon UV light irradiation, the CN bond between the 4H-cyclohexadienone ring and the imidazole ring in the colorless closed-ring isomer of PIC undergoes a homolytic cleavage, leading to the formation of the transient colored open-ring isomer. Based on the substituents on the imidazoyl/4H-cyclohexadienone rings and the nature of the aromatic linker, the half-life of the colored open-ring isomer can be varied between tens of nanoseconds and seconds. PIC derivatives containing a 1,2-phenylene linker exhibit high fatigue resistance toward repeated photochromic reactions. Analysis using laser flash photolysis reveals that the absorption spectra of the open-ring isomers are not readily rationalized by a straightforward superposition of the spectra of the two component radical fragments and the photogenerated radicals are electronically coupled through the aromatic linker. Furthermore, the open-ring isomer can be treated as a hybrid of the pure open-shell biradical and closed-shell quinoid resonance structures.","[Yamashita, Hiroaki; Ikezawa, Takahiro; Kobayashi, Yoichi; Abe, Jiro] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, Chuo Ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan; [Abe, Jiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020076, Japan","Abe, J (corresponding author), Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, Chuo Ku, 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan.",jiro_abe@chem.aoyama.ac.jp,"Abe, Jiro/B-2045-2010; Kobayashi, Yoichi/A-2343-2010","Abe, Jiro/0000-0002-0237-815X; Kobayashi, Yoichi/0000-0003-3339-3755","Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); MEXT, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [26107010]; MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26107010, 15K17846, 26620073] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported partly by the Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Photosynergetics (No. 26107010) from MEXT, Japan.

However, the samplings of vast conformational space of biomacromolecules by conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations might be insufficient, due to their inadequate accessible time-scales for investigating biological functions. Therefore, the development of methodologies for enhancing the conformational sampling of biomacromolecules still remains as a challenging issue in computational biology. To tackle this problem, we newly propose an efficient conformational search method, which is referred as TaBoo SeArch (TBSA) algorithm. In TBSA, an inverse energy histogram is used to select seeds for the conformational resampling so that states with high frequencies are inhibited, while states with low frequencies are efficiently sampled to explore the unvisited conformational space. As a demonstration, TBSA was applied to the folding of a mini-protein, chignolin, and automatically sampled the native structure (C root mean square deviation<1.0 angstrom) with nanosecond order computational costs started from a completely extended structure, although a long-time 1-mu s normal MD simulation failed to sample the native structure. Furthermore, a multiscale free energy landscape method based on the conformational sampling of TBSA were quantitatively evaluated through free energy calculations with both implicit and explicit solvent models, which enable us to find several metastable states on the folding landscape.

Atomistic simulations on the order of micro-to milliseconds are becoming feasible and are used to study the state-of-the-art experiments in atomistic detail. Yet, analyzing the high-dimensional-long-temporal trajectory data is still a challenging task and sometimes leads to contradictory results depending on the analyses. To reveal the dynamic aspect of the trajectory, here we propose a simple approach which uses a time correlation function matrix and apply to the folding/unfolding trajectory of FiP35 WW domain [Shaw et al., Science 330, 341 (2010)]. The approach successfully characterizes the slowest mode corresponding to the folding/unfolding transitions and determines the free energy barrier indicating that FiP35 is not an incipient downhill folder. The transition dynamics analysis further reveals that the folding/unfolding transition is highly heterogeneous, e.g., the transition path time varies by similar to 100 fold. We identify two misfolded states and show that the dynamic heterogeneity in the folding/unfolding transitions originates from the trajectory being trapped in the misfolded and half-folded intermediate states rather than the diffusion driven by a thermal noise. The current results help reconcile the conflicting interpretations of the folding mechanism and highlight the complexity in the folding dynamics. This further motivates the need to understand the transition dynamics beyond a simple free energy picture using simulations and single-molecule experiments.

Structural interpretation of the amide I line shapes is enabled by spectral simulations carried out on structures extracted from a recent Markov state model. The V3 label spectrum indicates that the beta-sheet contacts between strands I and II are well folded with minimal disorder. The V9 and V9G13 label spectra, which directly probe the hydrogen-bond contacts across the beta-turn, show significant disorder, indicating that molecular dynamics simulations tend to overstabilize ideally folded beta-turn structures in NTL9(1-39).

From a computational perspective, studying disorder events poses a challenge, as they typically occur on long timescales, and the associated molecules are often large (i.e., hundreds of residues). These size and time requirements make it advantageous to use computationally inexpensive models to characterize large-scale dynamics, where more highly detailed models can provide information about individual sub-steps associated with function. To reduce computational demand, one often uses a coarse-grained representation of the molecule or a simplified description of the energetics. In order to use simpler models to identify transient disorder in RNA and proteins, it is imperative that these models can accurately capture structural fluctuations about folded configurations, as well as the overall stability of each molecule. Here, we explore a class of simplified model for which all non-hydrogen atoms are explicitly represented. We find that this model can provide a consistent description of protein folding and native-basin dynamics for several representative biomolecules. We additionally show that the native-basin fluctuations of tRNA and the ribosome are robust to variations in the model. Finally, the extended variable loop in tRNA(Ile) is predicted to be very dynamic, which may facilitate biologically-relevant rearrangements. Together, this study provides a foundation that will aid in the application of simplified models to study disorder during function in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies.","[Jackson, Jovaun; Nguyen, Kien; Whitford, Paul Charles] Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Whitford, PC (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Phys, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jackson.jov@husky.neu.edu; nguyen.kie@husky.neu.edu; p.whitford@neu.edu,,,National Science Foundation CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1350312]; Northeastern University Discovery Cluster,This work was supported in part by a National Science Foundation CAREER Award (Grant No. MCB-1350312).

Starting from their experimental structures, 1.0 mu s unrestrained simulations at 298 K retain most of the native structures quite well except for a few flexible terminals and long internal loops. Starting from each homology model, a 150 ns MD simulation at 380 K generates the best RMSD improvement of 0.85 angstrom on average. The structural improvements roughly correlate with the RMSD of the initial homology models, indicating possible consistent structure refinement. Finally, targets TR614 and TR624 have been subjected to long-time replica-exchange MD simulations. Significant structural improvements are generated, with RMSD of 1.91 and 1.36 angstrom with respect to their crystal structures.

Mutations in the insulin gene can impair the folding of its precursor protein, proinsulin, and cause permanent neonatal-onset diabetes mellitus known as Mutant INS-gene induced Diabetes of Youth (MIDY) with insulin deficiency. To gain insights into the molecular basis of this diabetes-associated mutation, we perform molecular dynamics simulations in wild-type and mutant (Cys(A7) to Tyr or C(A7)Y) insulin A chain in aqueous solutions. The C(A7)Y mutation is one of the identified mutations that impairs the protein folding by substituting the cysteine residue which is required for the disulfide bond formation. A comparative analysis reveals structural differences between the wild-type and the mutant conformations. The analyzed mutant insulin A chain forms a metastable state with major effects on its N-terminal region.

HPA, which is transmitted by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, is caused by mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Most mutations are missense and lead to reduced protein stability and/or impaired catalytic function. The impact of such mutations varies, ranging from classical phenylketonuria (PKU), mild PKU, to non-PKU HPA phenotypes. Despite the fact that HPA is a monogenic disease, clinical data show that one PKU genotype can be associated with more in vivo phenotypes, which indicates the role of other (still unknown) factors. To better understand the phenotype-genotype relationships, we analyzed computationally the impact of missense mutations in homozygotes stored in the BIOPKU database. A total of 34 selected homozygous genotypes was divided into two main groups according to their phenotypes: (A) genotypes leading to non-PKU HPA or combined phenotype non-PKU HPA/mild PKU and (B) genotypes leading to classical PKU, mild PKU or combined phenotype mild PKU/classical PKU. Combining in silico analysis and molecular dynamics simulations (in total 3 mu s) we described the structural impact of the mutations, which allowed us to separate 32 out of 34 mutations between groups A and B. Testing the simulation conditions revealed that the outcome of mutant simulations can be modulated by the ionic strength. We also employed programs SNPs3D, Polyphen-2, and SIFT but based on the predictions performed we were not able to discriminate mutations with mild and severe PKU phenotypes.","[Reblova, Kamila; Kulhanek, Petr; Fajkusova, Lenka] Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol CEITEC, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Kulhanek, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Natl Ctr Biomol Res, CS-61137 Brno, Czech Republic","Reblova, K (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Cent European Inst Technol CEITEC, Kamenice 5, Brno 62500, Czech Republic.",kristina@physics.muni.cz,"Fajkusova, Lenka/K-5217-2018; Kulhanek, Petr/D-6884-2012","Kulhanek, Petr/0000-0002-4152-6514","CEITEC [CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068]; SuPReMMe [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0045]; Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LM2010005]; programme Center CERIT Scientific Cloud part of the Operational Program Research and Development for Innovations [CZ. 1.05/3.2.00/08.0144]","This study was supported by the project CEITEC (CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0068) and the project SuPReMMe (CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0045).

Scatterless slits reduce the parasitic scattering, a custom-designed miniature active beamstop ensures accurate data normalization and the photon-counting PILATUS 2M detector enables the background-free detection of weak scattering signals. The high flux and small beam size allow for rapid experiments with exposure time down to 30-50 ms covering the resolution range from about 300 to 0.5nm. P12 possesses a versatile and flexible sample environment system that caters for the diverse experimental needs required to study macromolecular solutions. These include an in-vacuum capillary mode for standard batch sample analyses with robotic sample delivery and for continuous-flow in-line sample purification and characterization, as well as an in-air capillary time-resolved stopped-flow setup. A novel microfluidic centrifugal mixing device (SAXS disc) is developed for a high-throughput screening mode using sub-microlitre sample volumes. Automation is a key feature of P12; it is controlled by a beamline meta server, which coordinates and schedules experiments from either standard or nonstandard operational setups. The integrated SASFLOW pipeline automatically checks for consistency, and processes and analyses the data, providing near real-time assessments of overall parameters and the generation of low-resolution models within minutes of data collection. These advances, combined with a remote access option, allow for rapid high-throughput analysis, as well as time-resolved and screening experiments for novice and expert biological SAXS users.","[Blanchet, Clement E.; Spilotros, Alessandro; Graewert, Melissa A.; Kikhney, Alexey; Jeffries, Cy M.; Franke, Daniel; Fiedler, Stefan; Roessle, Manfred; Svergun, Dmitri I.] European Mol Biol Lab, Hamburg Outstn, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany; [Schwemmer, Frank; Mark, Daniel; Zengerle, Roland] Univ Freiburg, Lab MEMS Applicat, IMTEK Dept Microsyst Engn, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Cipriani, Florent] European Mol Biol Lab, Grenoble Outstn, F-38042 Grenoble, France","Blanchet, CE (corresponding author), European Mol Biol Lab, Hamburg Outstn, Notkestr 85, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany.",clement.blanchet@embl-hamburg.de; d.svergun@embl-hamburg.de,"Zengerle, Roland/B-2451-2012",/0000-0002-8718-7343,European Community under BioStruct-X [283570]; Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [05ES7YE1]; BioSCAT [05K12YE1]; SAXS-CD [05K10VFB]; Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0017/2012]; EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme (EIPOD),"This work was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under BioStruct-X (grant agreement No. 283570), Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) projects 'Synchrotronstrahlfuehrungen fur strukturbiologische Forschung am PETRA III Speicher-ring' (05ES7YE1), BioSCAT (05K12YE1) and SAXS-CD (05K10VFB), Human Frontier Science Program (RGP0017/2012), and the EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme (EIPOD, to MAG).",,54,229,230,0,41,INT UNION CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,CHESTER,"2 ABBEY SQ, CHESTER, CH1 2HU, ENGLAND",1600-5767,,,J APPL CRYSTALLOGR,J.

Atomic motions in molecules are nonlinear, which suggests that simulations with enhanced sampling of collective motions traced by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods may perform better than linear ones. In this study, we compare an unbiased folding simulation of the Trp-cage miniprotein with metadynamics simulations using both linear (principle component analysis) and nonlinear (Isomap) low dimensional embeddings as collective variables. Folding of the mini-protein was successfully simulated in 200 ns simulation with linear biasing and non-linear motion biasing. The folded state was correctly predicted as the free energy minimum in both simulations. We found that the advantage of linear motion biasing is that it can sample a larger conformational space, whereas the advantage of nonlinear motion biasing lies in slightly better resolution of the resulting free energy surface. In terms of sampling efficiency, both methods are comparable.

Implicit-solvent simulations can speed up conformational sampling significantly. We compare the speed of conformational sampling between two commonly used methods of each class: the explicit-solvent particle mesh Ewald (PME) with TIP3P water model and a popular generalized Born (GB) implicit-solvent model, as implemented in the AMBER package. We systematically investigate small (dihedral angle flips in a protein), large (nucleosome tail collapse and DNA unwrapping), and mixed (folding of a miniprotein) conformational changes, with nominal simulation times ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds depending on system size. The speedups in conformational sampling for GB relative to PME simulations, are highly system-and problem-dependent. Where the simulation temperatures for PME and GB are the same, the corresponding speedups are approximately onefold (small conformational changes), between similar to 1- and similar to 100-fold (large changes), and approximately sevenfold (mixed case). The effects of temperature on speedup and free-energy landscapes, which may differ substantially between the solvent models, are discussed in detail for the case of miniprotein folding. In addition to speeding up conformational sampling, due to algorithmic differences, the implicit solvent model can be computationally faster for small systems or slower for large systems, depending on the number of solute and solvent atoms. For the conformational changes considered here, the combined speedups are approximately twofold, similar to 1- to 60-fold, and similar to 50-fold, respectively, in the low solvent viscosity regime afforded by the implicit solvent. For all the systems studied, 1) conformational sampling speedup increases as Langevin collision frequency (effective viscosity) decreases; and 2) conformational sampling speedup is mainly due to reduction in solvent viscosity rather than possible differences in free-energy landscapes between the solvent models.","[Anandakrishnan, Ramu; Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Drozdetski, Aleksander; Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Dept Phys, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Walker, Ross C.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego Supercomp Ctr, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Walker, Ross C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, San Diego, CA 92103 USA","Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",alexey@cs.vt.edu,"Anandakrishnan, Ramu/AAB-9040-2020","Anandakrishnan, Ramu/0000-0003-0422-3984; Onufriev, Alexey/0000-0002-4930-6612","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM076121]; Burroughs-Wellcome fundBurroughs Wellcome Fund [1011306]; National Science Foundation SI2-SSE [NSF-1047875, NSF-1148276]; University of California UC LabUniversity of California System [09-LR-06-117793]; NVIDIA; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-0960081]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1148276] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1148276] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant GM076121 to A.O., Burroughs-Wellcome fund grant1011306 to R.A., National Science Foundation SI2-SSE grants NSF-1047875 and NSF-1148276 to R.C.W., a University of California UC Lab 09-LR-06-117793 grant to R.C.W., a fellowship from NVIDIA, and National Science Foundation grant CNS-0960081.",,100,78,78,1,45,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Thus, the ability to modify the sequence, and hence the structure and activity, of individual proteins in a systematic way, opens up many opportunities, both scientifically and (as we focus on here) for exploitation in biocatalysis. Modern methods of synthetic biology, whereby increasingly large sequences of DNA can be synthesised de novo, allow an unprecedented ability to engineer proteins with novel functions. However, the number of possible proteins is far too large to test individually, so we need means for navigating the `search space' of possible protein sequences efficiently and reliably in order to find desirable activities and other properties. Enzymologists distinguish binding (K-d) and catalytic (k(cat)) steps. In a similar way, judicious strategies have blended design (for binding, specificity and active site modelling) with the more empirical methods of classical directed evolution (DE) for improving kcat (where natural evolution rarely seeks the highest values), especially with regard to residues distant from the active site and where the functional linkages underpinning enzyme dynamics are both unknown and hard to predict. Epistasis (where the `best' amino acid at one site depends on that or those at others) is a notable feature of directed evolution. The aim of this review is to highlight some of the approaches that are being developed to allow us to use directed evolution to improve enzyme properties, often dramatically. We note that directed evolution differs in a number of ways from natural evolution, including in particular the available mechanisms and the likely selection pressures. Thus, we stress the opportunities afforded by techniques that enable one to map sequence to (structure and) activity in silico, as an effective means of modelling and exploring protein landscapes. Because known landscapes may be assessed and reasoned about as a whole, simultaneously, this offers opportunities for protein improvement not readily available to natural evolution on rapid timescales. Intelligent landscape navigation, informed by sequence-activity relationships and coupled to the emerging methods of synthetic biology, offers scope for the development of novel biocatalysts that are both highly active and robust.","[Currin, Andrew; Swainston, Neil; Day, Philip J.; Kell, Douglas B.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Currin, Andrew; Kell, Douglas B.] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Currin, Andrew; Swainston, Neil; Day, Philip J.; Kell, Douglas B.] Univ Manchester, Ctr Synthet Biol Fine & Special Chem SYNBIOCHEM, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Swainston, Neil] Univ Manchester, Sch Comp Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Day, Philip J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Comp Sci, Manchester M13 9PT, Lancs, England","Kell, DB (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, 131 Princess St, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England.",dbk@manchester.ac.uk,"Kell, Douglas/E-8318-2011","Kell, Douglas/0000-0001-5838-7963",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M017702/1],"We thank Chris Knight, Rainer Breitling, Nigel Scrutton and Nick Turner for very useful comments on the manuscript, Colin Levy for some material for the figures, and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for financial support (grant BB/M017702/1).

However, it has been unclear hitherto whether the C-H bond lengths in cryogenic protein structures are significantly different from those defined in forcefields to affect protein folding simulations. This article reports the finding that the C-H bonds in high resolution cryogenic protein structures are 10-14% shorter than those defined in current AMBER forcefields, according to 3709 C-H bonds in the cryogenic protein structures with resolutions of 0.62-0.79 angstrom. Also, 20 all-atom, isothermal isobaric, 0.5-mu s molecular dynamics simulations showed that chignolin folded from a fully-extended backbone formation to the native beta-hairpin conformation in the simulations using AMBER forcefield FF12SB at 300 K with an aggregated native state population including standard error of 10 +/- 4%. However, the aggregated native state population with standard error reduced to 3 +/- 2% in the same simulations except that C-H bonds were shortened by 10-14%. Furthermore, the aggregated native state populations with standard errors increased to 35 +/- 3% and 26 +/- 3% when using FF12MC, which is based on AMBER forcefield FF99, with and without the shortened C-H bonds, respectively. These results show that the 10-14% bond length differences can significantly affect protein folding simulations and suggest that re-parameterization of C-H bonds according to the cryogenic structures could improve the ability of a forcefield to fold proteins in molecular dynamics simulations.

In this article, we introduce the software design of REIN and demonstrate its applicability through benchmark simulations of alanine pentapeptide in explicit water, as well as the free-energy analysis of N-glycan and Tom20-presequence complex in solution.

The development of MD simulation program is closely related to the architecture of the computers. Recent trend of MD simulation is headed to large-scale calculation, long-time calculation of small systems, and calculation for large statistics. The most challenging one is the large-scale calculation. To realize the large-scale calculation, we have to efficiently control the massively parallel supercomputers with several 10 thousands of nodes. There, it is essential to develop software having a compatibility of such computer architecture. Recently, we have developed general-purpose MD software MODYLAS (MOlecular DYnamics simulation software for LArge Systems) for massively parallel supercomputers such as K-computer. Here, we describe the outline, important features, and computation of MODYLAS. An example result of the 200 ns-MD simulation of the viral capsid system consisting of about 6,500,000 atoms is also presented.

Despite intense research efforts, the atomic-level mechanism transmitting chemical energy from hydrolysis into mechanical force that translocates the substrate is still unclear. Here we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with advanced path sampling techniques and milestoning analysis to characterize how mRNA substrate is translocated by an exemplary homohexameric motor, the transcription termination factor Rho. We find that the release of hydrolysis product (ADP + Pi) triggers the force-generating process of Rho through a 0.1 millisecond-long conformational transition, the time scale seen also in experiment. The calculated free energy profiles and kinetics show that Rho unidirectionally translocates the single-stranded RNA substrate via a population shift of the conformational states of Rho; upon hydrolysis product release, the most favorable conformation shifts from the pretranslocation state to the post-translocation state. Via two previously unidentified intermediate states, the RNA chain is seen to be pulled by six K326 side chains, whose motions are induced by highly coordinated relative translation and rotation of Rhos six subunits. The present study not only reveals in new detail the mechanism employed by ring-shaped ATPase motors, for example the use of loosely bound and tightly bound hydrolysis reactant and product states to coordinate motor action, but also provides an effective approach to identify allosteric sites of multimeric enzymes in general.","[Ma, Wen; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ma, Wen; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Schulten, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kschulte@ks.uiuc.edu,"Ma, Wen/L-6708-2015","Ma, Wen/0000-0002-1123-5273","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [9P41GM104601]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY0822613]; Texas Advanced Computing Center via Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment grant [NSF-MCA93S028]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070]; State of Illinois; NSF Physics of Living Systems program [PHY-1026665]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1430124] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of PhysicsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1430124] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1440026] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (9P41GM104601) and from the National Science Foundation (PHY0822613).

Using a small number of coarse-grained sites (about one per eight atoms) but assigning an independent three-dimensional orientation to each site, we preferentially integrate out stiff degrees of freedom (bond lengths and angles, as well as dihedral angles in rings) that are accurately approximated by their average values, while retaining soft degrees of freedom (unconstrained dihedral angles) mostly responsible for conformational variability. We demonstrate that our scheme retains nearly atomistic resolution by mapping all experimental protein configurations in the Protein Data Bank onto coarse-grained configurations and then analytically backmapping those configurations back to all-atom configurations. This roundtrip mapping throws away all information associated with the eliminated (stiff) degrees of freedom except for their average values, which we use to construct optimal backmapping functions. Despite the 4:1 reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, we find that heavy atoms move only 0.051 angstrom on average during the roundtrip mapping, while hydrogens move 0.179 angstrom on average, an unprecedented combination of efficiency and accuracy among coarse-grained protein models.

Previously, it was shown that iteration of two such orthogonal sampling and scoring methods - Rosetta and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations - facilitated exploration of conformational space in principle. Here, we go beyond a proof-of-concept study and address significant remaining limitations of the iterative MD-Rosetta protein structure refinement protocol. Specifically, all parts of the iterative refinement protocol are now guided by medium-resolution cryoEM density maps, and previous knowledge about the native structure of the protein is no longer necessary. Models are identified solely based on score or simulation time. All four benchmark proteins showed substantial improvement through three rounds of the iterative refinement protocol. The best-scoring final models of two proteins had sub,Angstrom RMSD to the native structure over residues in secondary structure elements. Molecular dynamics was most efficient in refining secondary structure elements and was thus highly complementary to the Rosetta refinement which is most powerful in refining side chains and loop regions.","[Lindert, Steffen; McCammon, J.

The dynamic properties are extracted using Markov state models. For single-residue models (Ac-A-NHMe, Ac-V-NHMe), the slow conformational exchange processes are similar in all force fields, but the associated relaxation timescales differ by up to an order of magnitude. For the peptide systems, not only the relaxation timescales, but also the conformational exchange processes differ considerably across force fields.

The protein elasticity is described by the Gaussian network model (GNM), to which we add prescribed bond binding energies that are assigned to all (nonbackbone) connecting bonds in the GNM of native state and assumed identical for simplicity. Using exact calculation of the Helmholtz free energy for this model, we consider bond rupture single events. The bond designated for rupture is chosen by minimizing the free-energy difference for the process, over all (nonbackbone) bonds in the network. Plotting the free-energy profile along this pathway at different temperatures, we observe a few major partial unfolding, metastable or stable, states, that are separated by free-energy barriers and change role as the temperature is raised.

In the past decade, many small molecules, including NQTrp, have been identified to reduce aggregation and toxicity. However, due to the heterogeneity of the conformational ensemble of A beta with drugs, we lack detailed structures of the transient complexes. Following our previous simulation of the monomer of A beta 1-28, here we characterize the equilibrium ensemble of the A beta 1-28 monomer with NQTrp by means of extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations using a force field known to fold diverse proteins correctly. While the secondary structure content and the intrinsic disorder of the whole peptides are very similar and the lifetimes of the salt-bridges remain constant, the population of beta-hairpin is reduced by a factor of 1.5 and the population of a-helix in the region 17-24 is increased by a factor of two upon NQTrp binding. These two factors, which impact the free energy barrier for nucleation, provide a first explanation for the reported reduced A beta 1-40/1-42 aggregation kinetics in the presence of NQTrp. Backbone and side-chain interactions of A beta with NQTrp may also inhibit A beta-A beta contacts. The fraction of free A beta 1-28 monomer is, however, on the order of 20-25% at 17.5 mM, and this shows that the affinity of NQTrp is low and hence its inhibitory activity is not very strong. This inhibitor can be improved to reduce the formation of dimer, a critical step in aggregation and toxicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The recognition motif is characterized by the tetrahedral coordination of a zinc ion by conserved cysteine and histidine residues. We have characterized the prokaryotic Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger motif, included in the DNA binding region (Ros87) of Ros protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, demonstrating that, although possessing a similar zinc coordination sphere, this domain presents significant differences from its eukaryotic counterpart. Furthermore, basic residues flanking the zinc binding region on either side have been demonstrated, by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) experiments, to be essential for Ros DNA binding. In spite of this wealth of knowledge, the structural details of the mechanism through which the prokaryotic zinc fingers recognize their target genes are still unclear. Here, to gain insights into the molecular DNA recognition process of prokaryotic zinc finger domains we applied a strategy in which we performed molecular docking studies using a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations data. The results demonstrate that the MD ensemble provides a reasonable picture of Ros87 backbone dynamics in solution. The Ros87-DNA model indicates that the interaction involves the first two residue of the first alpha-helix, and several residues located in the basic regions flanking the zinc finger domain. Interestingly, the prokaryotic zinc finger domain, mainly with the C-terminal tail that is wrapped around the DNA, binds a more extended recognition site than the eukaryotic counterpart. Our analysis demonstrates that the introduction of the protein flexibility in docking studies can improve, in terms of accuracy, the quality of the obtained models and could be particularly useful for protein showing high conformational heterogeneity as well as for computational drug design applications.

Because protein structures are stabilized by local and nonlocal interactions among distal residues, dissecting individual substructures from the context of folded proteins results in large destabilization and loss of unique three-dimensional structure. Thus, mini-protein substructures can only rarely be derived from natural templates. Here, we describe a compact native 24-residues-long supersecondary structure derived from the hyperstable villin headpiece subdomain consisting of helices 2 and 3 (HP24). Using a combination of experimental techniques, including NMR and small-angle x-ray scattering, as well as all-atom replica exchange molecular-dynamics simulations, we show that a variant with stabilizing substitutions (HP24stab) forms a densely packed and compact conformation. In HP24stab, interactions between helices 2 and 3 are similar to those observed in native folded HP35, and the two helices cooperatively stabilize each other by completing the hydrophobic core lining the central part of HP35. Interestingly, even though the HP24wt fragment shows a more expanded and less structured conformation, NMR and simulations demonstrate a preference for a native-like topology. Thus, the two stabilizing residues in HP24stab shift the energy balance toward the native state, leading to a minimal folding motif.","[Hocking, Henry G.; Madl, Tobias] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, Dept Chem, Garching, Germany; [Hocking, Henry G.; Madl, Tobias] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Biol Struct, Neuherberg, Germany; [Haese, Florian; Zacharias, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept T38, Garching, Germany; [Madl, Tobias] Med Univ Graz, Inst Mol Biol & Biochem, Ctr Mol Med, Graz, Austria; [Rief, Matthias; Zoldak, Gabriel] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E22, Garching, Germany; [Rief, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Integrated Prot Sci Munich, Dept Phys, Garching, Germany","Zoldak, G (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept E22, Garching, Germany.",gabriel.zoldak@tum.de,"Zoldak, Gabriel/Q-7412-2017; Hase, Florian/Y-9650-2018; Zoldak, Gabriel/AAI-3266-2020; Madl, Tobias/B-1682-2012; Hase, Florian/B-1585-2018","Zoldak, Gabriel/0000-0002-5271-8837; Hase, Florian/0000-0003-3711-9761; Madl, Tobias/0000-0002-9725-5231; Hase, Florian/0000-0003-3711-9761; Hocking, Henry/0000-0003-0933-9265","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 863/A2, A10, ZO 291/1-1]; Bavarian Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts (Bavarian Molecular Biosystems Research Network); German Research Foundation (Emmy Noether program) [MA 5703/1-1]; Centre for Integrated Protein Science Munich; Nanosystems Initiative Munich","This work was supported by the SFB 863/A2,A10 and ZO 291/1-1 projects of Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; the Bavarian Ministry of Sciences, Research and the Arts (Bavarian Molecular Biosystems Research Network to T.M.); the German Research Foundation (Emmy Noether program MA 5703/1-1 to T.M.); and the Centre for Integrated Protein Science Munich.

Owing to this simplification, millisecond molecular dynamics simulations of large systems can be performed. While UNRES predicts overall folds well, it reproduces the details of local chain conformation with lower accuracy. Recently, we implemented new knowledge-based torsional potentials (Krupa et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 4620-4632) that depend on the virtual-bond dihedral angles involving side chains: C alpha...C alpha...C alpha...SC (tau((1))), SC...C alpha...C alpha...C alpha (tau((2))), and SC...Ca...Ca...SC (tau((3))) in the UNRES force field. These potentials resulted in significant improvement of the simulated structures, especially in the loop regions. In this work, we introduce the physics-based counterparts of these potentials, which we derived from the all-atom energy surfaces of terminally blocked amino-acid residues by Boltzmann integration over the angles lambda((1)) and lambda((2)) for rotation about the C alpha...C alpha virtual-bond angles and over the side-chain angles x. The energy surfaces were, in turn, calculated by using the semiempirical AM1 method of molecular quantum mechanics. Entropy contribution was evaluated with use of the harmonic approximation from Hessian matrices. One-dimensional Fourier series in the respective virtual-bond-dihedral angles were fitted to the calculated potentials, and these expressions have been implemented in the UNRES force field. Basic calibration of the UNRES force field with the new potentials was carried out with eight training proteins, by selecting the optimal weight of the new energy terms and reducing the weight of the regular torsional terms. The force field was subsequently benchmarked with a set of 22 proteins not used in the calibration. The new potentials result in a decrease of the root-mean-square deviation of the average conformation from the respective experimental structure by 0.86 angstrom on average; however, improvement of up to 5 angstrom was observed for some proteins.","[Sieradzan, Adam K.; Krupa, Pawel; Liwo, Adam; Czaplewski, Cezary] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80180 Gdansk, Poland; [Sieradzan, Adam K.; Krupa, Pawel; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Krupa, P (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80180 Gdansk, Poland.",vetinari@sun1.chem.univ.gda.pl,"Czaplewski, Cezary/E-1503-2016; Krupa, Pawel/S-2292-2016; Sieradzan, Adam/ABC-3552-2020; Krupa, Pawel/G-1676-2015","Czaplewski, Cezary/0000-0002-0294-3403; Krupa, Pawel/0000-0002-9710-7837; Sieradzan, Adam/0000-0002-2426-3644; ","Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)Foundation for Polish Science [MPD/2010/5, Mistrz 7./2013, 100.2014]; National Science Center of PolandNational Science Center, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [DEC-2011/01/N/ST4/01772]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB10-19767]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","This work was supported by Grants MPD/2010/5 and Mistrz 7./2013 and START scholarship (100.2014) from the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP), Grant DEC-2011/01/N/ST4/01772 from the National Science Center of Poland, and Grants from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and the National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767).

However, the result of a simulation is a large, high-dimensional time series that is difficult to interpret. Recent work has introduced the time-structure based Independent Components Analysis (tICA) method for analyzing MD, which attempts to find the slowest decorrelating linear functions of the molecular coordinates.

In OFLOOD, sparse distributions (outliers in the conformational space) were regarded as relevant states for the transitions. Then, the transitions were enhanced through conformational resampling from the outliers. This evidence indicates that the conformational resampling of the sparse distributions might increase chances for promoting the transitions from the outliers to other meta-stable states, which resembles a conformational flooding from the outliers to the neighboring clusters. OFLOOD consists of (i) detections of outliers from conformational distributions and (ii) conformational resampling from the outliers by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cycles of (i) and (ii) are simply repeated. As demonstrations, OFLOOD was applied to folding of Chignolin and HP35. In both cases, OFLOOD automatically extracted folding pathways from unfolded structures with ns-order computational costs, although mu s-order canonical MD failed to extract them.

We investigated short synthetic models of IDPs, purely composed of ionizable amino acid residues and therefore expected to display an extreme structural and dynamic response to pH variation. Two synergistic, custom-made, time-resolved fluorescence methods were applied in tandem to study the structure and dynamics of the acidic and basic hexapeptides Asp(6), Glu(6), Arg(6), Lys(6), and His(6) between pH 1 and 12. (i) End-to-end distances were obtained from the short-distance Forster resonance energy transfer (sdFRET) from N-terminal 5-fluoro-l-tryptophan (FTrp) to C-terminal Dbo. (ii) End-to-end collision rates were obtained for the same peptides from the collision-induced fluorescence quenching (CIFQ) of Dbo by FTrp. Unexpectedly, the very high increase of charge density at elevated pH had no dynamical or conformational consequence in the anionic chains, neither in the absence nor in the presence of salt, in conflict with the common view and in partial conflict with accompanying molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast, the cationic peptides responded to ionization but with surprising patterns that mirrored the rich individual characteristics of each side chain type. The contrasting results had to be interpreted, by considering salt screening experiments, N-terminal acetylation, and simulations, in terms of an interplay of local dielectric constant and peptide-length dependent side chain charge-charge repulsion, side chain functional group solvation, N-terminal and side chain charge-charge repulsion, and side chain-side chain as well as side chain-backbone interactions. The common picture that emerged is that Coulomb repulsion between water-solvated side chains is efficiently quenched in short peptides as long as side chains are not in direct contact with each other or the main chain.","[Norouzy, Amir; Assaf, Khaleel I.; Zhang, Shuai; Jacob, Maik H.; Nau, Werner M.] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Life Sci & Chem, D-28759 Bremen, Germany","Jacob, MH (corresponding author), Jacobs Univ Bremen, Dept Life Sci & Chem, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",m.jacob@jacobs-university.de; w.nau@jacobs-university.de,"Assaf, Khaleel/I-8807-2017; Nau, Werner/E-6686-2011","Assaf, Khaleel/0000-0003-4331-8492; Nau, Werner/0000-0002-7654-6232; Jacob, Maik/0000-0002-6722-9788; Norouzy, Amir/0000-0002-9712-6755",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [NA 686/6]; DAADDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD),"We thank Indrajit Ghosh for preliminary measurements, and Achim Gelessus, Danilo Roccatano, and Ulrich Kleinekathofer for MD discussions.

These conformational transitions are generally induced as slow dynamics upon collective motions, including biologically relevant large-amplitude fluctuations of proteins. Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool for extracting conformational transitions of proteins, it might still be difficult to reach time scales of the biological functions because the accessible time scales of MD simulations are far from biological time scales, even if straightforward conventional MD (CMD) simulations using massively parallel computers are employed. Thus, it is desirable to develop efficient methods to achieve canonical ensembles with low computational costs. From this perspective, we review several enhanced conformational sampling techniques of biomolecules developed by us. In our methods, multiple independent short-time MD simulations are employed instead of single straightforward long-time CMD simulations. Our basic strategy is as follows: (i) selection of initial seeds (initial structures) for the conformational sampling in restarting MD simulations. Here, the seeds should be selected as candidates with high potential to transit. (ii) Resampling from the selected seeds by initializing velocities in restarting short-time MD simulations. A cycle of these simple protocols might drastically promote the conformational transitions of biomolecules. (iii) Once reactive trajectories extracted from the cycles of short-time MD simulations are obtained, a free energy profile is evaluated by means of umbrella sampling (US) techniques with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) as a post-processing technique. For the selection of the initial seeds, we proposed four different choices: (1) Parallel CaScade molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD), (2) Fluctuation Flooding Method (FFM), (3) Outlier FLOODing (OFLOOD) method, and (4) TaBoo SeArch (TBSA) method. We demonstrate applications of our methods to several biological systems, such as domain motions of proteins with large-amplitude fluctuations, conformational transitions upon ligand binding, and protein folding/refolding to native structures of proteins. Finally, we show the conformational sampling efficiencies of our methods compared with those by CMD simulations and other previously developed enhanced conformational sampling methods.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Harada, Ryuhei; Takano, Yu; Shigeta, Yasuteru] JST, CREST, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Takano, Yu] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Baba, Takeshi] Osaka Univ, Dept Mat Engn Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5608531, Japan; [Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Dept Phys, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan","Harada, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.",shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25104716, 25104717, 26102525, 26107004, 26105012]; Strategic Programs for Innovative Research (SPIRE), MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Computational Materials Science Initiative (CMSI), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26840056];  [02503029]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26107004] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work is supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Computics'', Dynamic ordering and biofunction'', Photosynergetics'', and 3-D Active-Site Science'' (No. 25104716, 25104717, 26102525, 26107004, and 26105012) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and by the Strategic Programs for Innovative Research (SPIRE), MEXT, and the Computational Materials Science Initiative (CMSI), Japan.

The former assumes that free energy minimum is the exclusive dominant mechanism in most cases, while the latter shows that some proteins have even lower free energy in intermediate states and their native states are kinetically trapped in the higher free energy region. This article explores the stability condition of protein structures on the basis of our study of complex chemical systems. We believe that separating one from another is not reasonable since they should be coupled, and protein structures should be dominated by at least two mechanisms resulting in different characteristic states. It is concluded that: (1) Structures of proteins are dynamic, showing multiple characteristic states emerging alternately and each dominated by a respective mechanism. (2) Compromise in competition of multiple dominant mechanisms might be the key to understanding the stability of protein structures. (3) The dynamic process of protein folding should be depicted through the time series of both its energetic and structural changes, which is much meaningful and applicable than the free energy landscape.","[Xu, Ji; Han, Mengzhi; Ren, Ying; Li, Jinghai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Han, Mengzhi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China","Ren, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",yren@ipe.ac.cn,"Li, Jinghai/L-4066-2013",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21103195]; Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesKnowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KGCX2-YW-124],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21103195) and the Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (KGCX2-YW-124).

The object of our investigation is a pair of G-domains of relatively large size, 200 amino adds each, with an experimental stability gap of about 40 K. The OPEP force field is able to maintain stable the fold of these relatively large proteins within the hundred-nanosecond time scale without including external constraints. This makes possible to characterize the conformational landscape of the folded protein as well as to explore the unfolding. In agreement with all-atom simulations used as a reference, we show that the conformational landscape of the thermophilic protein is characterized by a larger number of substates with slower dynamics on the network of states and more resilient to temperature increase. Moreover, we verify the stability gap between the two proteins using replica-exchange simulations and estimate a difference between the melting temperatures of about 23 K, in fair agreement with experiment. The detailed investigation of the unfolding thermodynamics allows to gain insight into the mechanism underlying the enhanced stability of the thermophile relating it to a smaller heat capacity of unfolding.

A brief overview is also provided of the experimental biophysical methods that are commonly used to probe biomolecular structure and dynamics, and the accuracy of the information that can be obtained from each is compared with that from modelling.

In a systematic way the reader is guided through the most recent and representative examples describing at the atomistic level of detail the structural modalities and the chemico-physical principles through which amino acids, polypeptides and folded proteins interact with GNMs' surface, thereby taking into consideration the mutual effects of both protein structural complexity and nanomaterial topology.

Straightforward applications, however, are often hampered by incomplete sampling, since in a typical simulated trajectory the system will spend most of its time trapped by high energy barriers in restricted regions of the configuration space. Over the years, several techniques have been designed to overcome this problem and enhance space sampling. Here, we review a class of methods that rely on the idea of extending the set of dynamical variables of the system by adding extra ones associated to functions describing the process under study. In particular, we illustrate the Temperature Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (TAMD), Logarithmic Mean Force Dynamics (LogMFD), and Multiscale Enhanced Sampling (MSES) algorithms. We also discuss combinations with techniques for searching reaction paths. We show the advantages presented by this approach and how it allows to quickly sample important regions of the free-energy landscape via automatic exploration.","[Fujisaki, Hiroshi] Nippon Med Sch, Dept Phys, Tokyo, Japan; [Moritsugu, Kei] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Matsunaga, Yasuhiro] Adv Inst Computat Sci, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Morishita, Tetsuya] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Maragliano, Luca] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Synapt Neurosci, Genoa, Italy","Maragliano, L (corresponding author), Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Synapt Neurosci, Adv Biotecnol Ctr CBA, Largo Rosanna Benzi 10, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",luca.maragliano@iit.it,"MARAGLIANO, Luca/A-8294-2010","MARAGLIANO, Luca/0000-0002-5705-6967",,,,82,13,13,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-4185,,,FRONT BIOENG BIOTECH,Front.

The results have been compared with available experimental data in both a qualitative and a quantitative manner. Complexities of the folding pathways, which cannot be determined experimentally, were revealed. The folding mechanisms obtained from the simulated folding kinetics are in agreement with experimental results, with a few discrepancies for which we have accounted. The origins of single- and double-exponential kinetics and their correlations with two- and three-state folding scenarios are shown to be related to the relative barrier heights between the various states. The rate constants obtained from time profiles of the fractions of the native, intermediate, and unfolded structures, and the kinetic equations fitted to them, correlate with the experimental values; however, they are about three orders of magnitude larger than the experimental ones for most of the systems. These differences are in agreement with the timescale extension derived by scaling down the friction of water and averaging out the fast degrees of freedom when passing from all-atom to a coarse-grained representation. Our results indicate that the UNRES force field can provide accurate predictions of folding kinetics of these WW domains, often used as models for the study of the mechanisms of proein folding.","[Zhou, Rui; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Zhou, Rui; Xiao, Yi] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Biomol Phys & Modeling Grp, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Rui; Czaplewski, Cezary; Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Lab Mol Modeling, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Sunol, David; Todorovski, Toni; Macias, Maria J.] Inst Biomed Res, Struct & Computat Biol Programme, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Macias, Maria J.] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Maisuradze, GG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gm56@cornell.edu; has5@cornell.edu; adam@chem.univ.gda.pl,"Todorovski, Toni/M-5277-2014; Czaplewski, Cezary/E-1503-2016; Macias, Maria J/K-3898-2014","Todorovski, Toni/0000-0002-9168-2830; Czaplewski, Cezary/0000-0002-0294-3403; Sunol, David/0000-0002-1421-8911; Macias, Maria J/0000-0002-6915-963X","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB10-19767]; Polish Ministry of Science and EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [530-8370-D498-14]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31300598]; Spanish National Research Program [Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness] [SAF2011-25119]; Regional, National, and International Programmes - Marie Curie Actions grant; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); ICREAICREA Funding Source: Custom","This research was conducted by using the resources of (i) our 588-processor Beowulf cluster at the Baker Laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University; (ii) the Informatics center of the Metropolitan Academic Network in Gdansk; (iii) our 96-processor cluster at the Biomolecular Physics and Modeling Group, Department of Physics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; and (iv) the National Science Foundation Terascale Computing System at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.

In other words, what interactions govern the molecule's energy landscape? To accomplish this, it is necessary to determine which degrees of freedom can unambiguously identify each transition state. Here, we perform simulations of large-scale aminoacyl-transfer RNA ( aa-tRNA) rearrangements during accommodation on the ribosome and project the dynamics along experimentally accessible atomic distances. From this analysis, we obtain evidence for which coordinates capture the correct number of barrier-crossing events and accurately indicate when the aa-tRNA is on a transition path. Although a commonly used coordinate in single-molecule experiments performs poorly, this study implicates alternative coordinates along which rearrangements are accurately described as diffusive movements across a one-dimensional free-energy profile. From this, we provide the theoretical foundation required for single-molecule techniques to uncover the energy landscape governing aa-tRNA selection by the ribosome.","[Noel, Jeffrey K.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX USA; [Chahine, Jorge; Leite, Vitor B.

Since that time, the folding mechanisms of small, water-soluble proteins have been well characterised. By contrast, progress in understanding the biogenesis and folding mechanisms of integral membrane proteins has lagged significantly because of the need to create a membrane mimetic environment for folding studies in vitro and the difficulties in finding suitable conditions in which reversible folding can be achieved. Improved knowledge of the factors that promote membrane protein folding and disfavour aggregation now allows studies of folding into lipid bilayers in vitro to be performed. Consequently, mechanistic details and structural information about membrane protein folding are now emerging at an ever increasing pace. Using the panoply of methods developed for studies of the folding of water-soluble proteins. This review summarises current knowledge of the mechanisms of outer membrane protein biogenesis and folding into lipid bilayers in vivo and in vitro and discusses the experimental techniques utilised to gain this information. The emerging knowledge is beginning to allow comparisons to be made between the folding of membrane proteins with current understanding of the mechanisms of folding of water-soluble proteins.

Here, current and recent SAXS-driven developments are described, with an emphasis on computational modeling. In particular, accurate methods to computing one theoretical scattering profile from a given structure model are discussed, with a key focus on structure factor coarse-graining and hydration contribution. Methods for reconstructing topological structures from an experimental SAXS profile are currently under active development. We report on several modeling tools designed for conformation generation that make use of either atomic-level or coarse-grained representations. Furthermore, since large, flexible biomolecules can adopt multiple well-defined conformations, a traditional single-conformation SAXS analysis is inappropriate, so we also discuss recent methods that utilize the concept of ensemble optimization, weighing in on the SAXS contributions of a heterogeneous mixture of conformations. These tools will ultimately posit the usefulness of SAXS data beyond a simple space-filling approach by providing a reliable structure characterization of biomolecular complexes under physiological conditions.","[Yang, Sichun] Ctr Prote, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Yang, Sichun] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Pharmacol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Yang, SC (corresponding author), Ctr Prote, 10900

Fine-grid, explicit water thermodynamic integration calculations using two widely used explicit water models (TIP3P and TIP4P-Ew) were performed on 19 natural amino acids and compared with experimental hydration free energies of corresponding side-chain analogs to establish expected accuracy levels for this charge model. Next, parameters previously derived for 17 unnatural amino acids and several new parameters optimized in this work were assessed using the same methodology. We found that the ff03 charge model is correlated with experimental hydration free energies but underestimates the solubilities of several polar natural and unnatural amino acids. Comparisons are presented with other forcefields and water models recently presented in the literature for both natural and modified amino acids. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Crystallographic studies have provided key molecular insights into this interaction; however, due to inherent features of the structural approach, the image of TCR-pMHC interactions that has emerged is a static one. In this review, we discuss how molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can complement and extend current experimental methods aimed at examining TCR-pMHC dynamics. We review the insights obtained from studies that leverage MD approaches, and propose that an integrative strategy that harnesses both MD simulations and structural and biophysical methods will provide new inroads into understanding the transitory and dynamic molecular events that dictate TCR signaling and T cell activation.","[Kass, Itamar; Buckle, Ashley M.; Borg, Natalie A.] Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Kass, Itamar] Monash Univ, Victorian Life Sci Computat Initiat Life Sci Comp, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Buckle, AM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",ashley.buckle@monash.edu; natalie.borg@monash.edu,"Buckle, Ashley/P-8366-2016","Buckle, Ashley/0000-0003-2943-9044; Kass, Itamar/0000-0002-5368-937X; Borg, Natalie/0000-0002-8677-9056",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia; Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council,This work was supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Research Council (ARC).

Here we provide evidence of how a novel parametrization of the Caterpillar model may be used for both quantitative protein design and folding. With computer simulations it is shown that, for a large set of real protein structures, the model produces designed sequences with similar physical properties to the corresponding natural occurring sequences. The designed sequences require further experimental testing. For an independent set of proteins, previously used as benchmark, the correct folded structure of both the designed and the natural sequences is also demonstrated. The equilibrium folding properties are characterized by free energy calculations. The resulting free energy profiles not only are consistent among natural and designed proteins, but also show a remarkable precision when the folded structures are compared to the experimentally determined ones. Ultimately, the updated Caterpillar model is unique in the combination of its fundamental three features: its simplicity, its ability to produce natural foldable designed sequences, and its structure prediction precision. It is also remarkable that low frustration sequences can be obtained with such a simple and universal design procedure, and that the folding of natural proteins shows funnelled free energy landscapes without the need of any potentials based on the native structure.","Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna, Austria","Coluzza, I (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Fac Phys, Vienna, Austria.",ivan.coluzza@univie.ac.at,"Coluzza, Ivan/I-4170-2015","Coluzza, Ivan/0000-0001-7728-6033",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P23846-N16],"Funding: We acknowledge support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) project P23846-N16.

Especially, the temperature dependence of the folding rate remains unsolved in the literature. Starting from the assumption that protein folding is an event of quantum transition between molecular conformations, we calculated the folding rate for all two-state proteins in a database and studied their temperature dependencies. The non-Arrhenius temperature relation for 16 proteins, whose experimental data had previously been available, was successfully interpreted by comparing the Arrhenius plot with the first-principle calculation. A statistical formula for the prediction of two-state protein folding rate was proposed based on quantum folding theory. The statistical comparisons of the folding rates for 65 two-state proteins were carried out, and the theoretical vs. experimental correlation coefficient was 0.73. Moreover, the maximum and the minimum folding rates given by the theory were consistent with the experimental results.","[Lv Jun] Inner Mongolia Univ Technol, Coll Sci, Ctr Phys Expt, Hohhot 010051, Peoples R China; [Luo LiaoFu] Inner Mongolia Univ, Fac Phys Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China","Lv, J (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ Technol, Coll Sci, Ctr Phys Expt, Hohhot 010051, Peoples R China.",lujun@imut.edu.cn,,,Distinguished Scientist Award of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,This work was supported by the Distinguished Scientist Award of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (2008).

The beta-hairpins of FBP28 WW domain and IgG are stable and have been proved to initiate the folding and are, therefore, suitable for studying the influence of charged residues on beta-hairpin conformation. In this paper, we carried out NMR examination of the conformations in solution of two fragments from the FPB28 protein (PDB code: 1E0L) (N-terminal part) namely KTADGKT-NH2 (1E0L 12-18, D7) and YKTADGKTY-NH2 (1E0L 11-19, D9), one from the B3 domain of the protein G (PDB code: 1IGD), namely DDATKT-NH2 (1IGD 51-56) (Dag1), and three variants of Dag1 peptide: DVATKT-NH2 (Dag2), OVATKT-NH2 (Dag3) and KVATKT-NH2 (Dag4), respectively, in which the original charged residue were replaced with non-polar residues or modified charged residues. It was found that both the D7 and D9 peptides form a large fraction bent conformations. However, no hydrophobic contacts between the terminal Tyr residues of D9 occur, which suggests that the presence of a pair of like-charged residues stabilizes chain reversal. Conversely, only the Dag1 and Dag2 peptides exhibit some chain reversal; replacing the second aspartic-acid residue with a valine and the first one with a basic residue results in a nearly extended conformation. These results suggest that basic residues farther away in sequence can result in stabilization of chain reversal owing to screening of the non-polar core. Conversely, smaller distance in sequence prohibits this screening, while the presence oppositely-charged residues can stabilize a turn because of salt-bridge formation.","[Makowska, Joanna; Uber, Dorota; Chmurzynski, Lech] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Zmudzinska, Wioletta] Med Univ Gdansk, Intercollegiate Fac Biotechnol, Univ Gdansk, PL-80822 Gdansk, Poland","Makowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",joanna.makowska@ug.edu.pl,"Zmudzinska, Wioletta/X-2679-2019","Zmudzinska, Wioletta/0000-0002-4561-6138; Chmurzynski, Lech/0000-0003-2707-0255",Polish National Science Centre [NCN 2011/01/D/ST4/04497],This work was supported by a grant from the Polish National Science Centre (NCN 2011/01/D/ST4/04497).

A Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD) approach has been developed that combines information extracted from an ENM analysis with atomistic explicit solvent MD simulations. Based on a set of centers representing rigid segments (centroids) of a protein, a distance-dependent biasing potential is constructed by means of an ENM analysis to promote and guide centroid/domain rearrangements. The biasing potentials are added with different magnitude to the force field description of the MD simulation along the replicas with one reference replica under the control of the original force field. The magnitude and the form of the biasing potentials are adapted during the simulation based on the average sampled conformation to reach a near constant biasing in each replica after equilibration. This allows for canonical sampling of conformational states in each replica. The application of the methodology to a two-domain segment of the glycoprotein 130 and to the protein cyanovirin-N indicates significantly enhanced global domain motions and improved conformational sampling compared with conventional MD simulations.

We study the surface of hafnium diboride, a conductive ultrahigh temperature ceramic material that can be grown in amorphous films. Our scanning tunneling movies have a second-to-hour dynamic range and single-point current measurements extend that to the millisecond-to-minute time scale. On the a-HfB2 glass surface, two-state hopping of 1-2 nm diameter cooperatively rearranging regions or clusters occurs from sub-milliseconds to hours. We characterize individual clusters in detail through high-resolution (<0.5 nm) imaging, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and voltage modulation, ruling out individual atoms, diffusing adsorbates, or pinned charges as the origin of the observed two-state hopping. Smaller clusters are more likely to hop, larger ones are more likely to be immobile. HfB2 has a very high bulk glass transition temperature T-g, and we observe no three-state hopping or sequential two-state hopping previously seen on lower T-g glass surfaces. The electronic density of states of clusters does not change when they hop up or down, allowing us to calibrate an accurate relative z-axis scale. By directly measuring and histogramming single cluster vertical displacements, we can reconstruct the local free energy landscape of individual clusters, complete with activation barrier height, a reaction coordinate in nanometers, and the shape of the free energy landscape basins between which hopping occurs. The experimental images are consistent with the compact shape of alpha-relaxors predicted by random first order transition theory, whereas the rapid hopping rate, even taking less confined motion at the surface into account, is consistent with beta-relaxations. We make a proposal of how mixed features can show up in surface dynamics of glasses.

These results indicate that modern force fields can reproduce the energy surface near the native structure. To test how well the force fields recapitulate the other regions of the energy surface, MD trajectories for a variant of protein G are compared with data from site-resolved hydrogen exchange (HX) and other biophysical measurements. Because HX monitors the breaking of individual H-bonds, this experimental technique identifies the stability and H-bond content of excited states, thus enabling quantitative comparison with the simulations. Contrary to experimental findings of a cooperative, all-or-none unfolding process, the simulated denatured state ensemble, on average, is highly collapsed with some transient or persistent native 2 degrees structure. The MD trajectories of this protein G variant and other small proteins exhibit excessive intramolecular H-bonding even for the most expanded conformations, suggesting that the force fields require improvements in describing H-bonding and backbone hydration. Moreover, these comparisons provide a general protocol for validating the ability of simulations to accurately capture rare structural fluctuations.","[Skinner, John J.; Yu, Wookyung; Gichana,

This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, similar to 20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the new view model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon-foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the how and the why questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon-foldon interactions that construct the native structure.","[Englander, S.

Instead, they are able to attain multiple conformations, bind to multiple targets, and respond to changes in their surroundings. Functionally, IDPs have been associated with molecular recognition, cell regulation, and signal transduction. The dynamic conformational ensemble of IDPs is highly environmental and binding partner dependent, rendering the characterization of IDPs extremely challenging. Here, we compare the sampling efficiencies of conventional molecular dynamics (MD), well-tempered metadynamics (WT-META), and bias-exchange metadynamics (BE-META). The total simulation time was over 10 mu s, and a 20-mer peptide derived from the Neh2 domain of the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein was simulated. BE-META, with a neutral replica and seven biased replicas employing a set of seven relevant collective variables (CVs), provided the most reliable and efficient sampling. Finally, we propose a free-energy reconstruction method based on the probability distribution of the secondary structure contents. This postprocessing analysis confirms the presence of not only the beta-hairpin conformation of the free Neh2 peptide but also its rare bound-state-like conformation, both of that have been experimentally observed. In addition, our simulations also predict other possible conformations to be verified with future experiments.","[Trang Nhu Do; Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Trang Nhu Do; Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo Inst Nanotechnol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Choy, Wing-Yiu] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada","Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",mkarttu@gmail.com,"Karttunen, Mikko/G-4531-2010; Choy, Wing-Yiu/O-7608-2017","Karttunen, Mikko/0000-0002-8626-3033; Choy, Wing-Yiu/0000-0002-2124-7278",Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP 74679]; University of Waterloo; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank Dr. Elio Cino for useful discussions.

To address these issues, we make the simplest possible change, by modifying the short-range proteinwater pair interactions, and leaving all the waterwater and proteinprotein parameters unchanged. We find that a modest strengthening of proteinwater interactions is sufficient to recover the correct dimensions of intrinsically disordered or unfolded proteins, as determined by direct comparison with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data. The modification also results in more realistic protein-protein affinities, and average solvation free energies of model compounds which are more consistent with experiment. Most importantly, we show that this scaling is small enough not to affect adversely the stability of the folded state, with only a modest effect on the stability of model peptides forming a-helix and Beta-sheet structures. The proposed adjustment opens the way to more accurate atomistic simulations of proteins, particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins, proteinprotein association, and crowded cellular environments.","[Best, Robert B.; Zheng, Wenwei] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Mittal, Jeetain] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov; jeetain@lehigh.edu,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Zheng, Wenwei/M-5031-2015","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; Zheng, Wenwei/0000-0002-9603-009X","National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Insitutes of Health; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1120399, TG-MCB-120014]","We thank Magnus Kjaergaard and Birthe Kragelund for kindly making available the original SAXS data for ACTR, and Kresten Lindorff-Larsen for helpful comments on the manuscript.

However, these approaches do not consider the fact that the contacts in a protein are neither randomly, nor independently distributed, but actually follow precise rules governed by the structure of the protein and thus are interdependent. Here, we present PconsC2, a novel method that uses a deep learning approach to identify protein-like contact patterns to improve contact predictions. A substantial enhancement can be seen for all contacts independently on the number of aligned sequences, residue separation or secondary structure type, but is largest for b-sheet containing proteins. In addition to being superior to earlier methods based on statistical inferences, in comparison to state of the art methods using machine learning, PconsC2 is superior for families with more than 100 effective sequence homologs. The improved contact prediction enables improved structure prediction.","[Skwark, Marcin J.; Raimondi, Daniele; Michel, Mirco; Elofsson, Arne] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Skwark, Marcin J.; Raimondi, Daniele; Michel, Mirco; Elofsson, Arne] Stockholm Univ, Sci Life Lab, Solna, Sweden; [Skwark, Marcin J.] Aalto Univ, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Aalto, Finland; [Raimondi, Daniele] ULB VUB, Interuniv Inst Bioinformat Brussels, Brussels, Belgium","Skwark, MJ (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",arne@bioinfo.se,"Skwark, Marcin Jerzy/Y-4019-2018","Skwark, Marcin Jerzy/0000-0002-2022-6766","Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [VR-NT 2012-5046, VR-M 2010-3555]; SSF (the Foundation for Strategic Research)Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research; Vinnova through the Vinnova-JSP programVinnova; EUEuropean Union (EU) [FP7-HEALTH-F4-2007-201924]; TranSys, a Marie Curie ITN [FP7-PEOPLE-2007-ITN-215524]; Academy of Finland (Finnish Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research COIN) [251170]; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)","This work was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council (VR-NT 2012-5046, VR-M 2010-3555), SSF (the Foundation for Strategic Research) and Vinnova through the Vinnova-JSP program, the EU 7'Th Framework Program by support to the EDICT project, contract No: FP7-HEALTH-F4-2007-201924.

We use this strategy to compare the intellectual status and available evidence for two models or views of mechanisms of transmembrane drug transport into intact biological cells. One (BDII) asserts that lipoidal phospholipid Bilayer Diffusion Is Important, while a second (PBIN) proposes that in normal intact cells Phospholipid Bilayer diffusion Is Negligible (i.e., may be neglected quantitatively), because evolution selected against it, and with transmembrane drug transport being effected by genetically encoded proteinaceous carriers or pores, whose natural biological roles, and substrates are based in intermediary metabolism. Despite a recent review elsewhere, we can find no evidence able to support BDII as we can find no experiments in intact cells in which phospholipid bilayer diffusion was either varied independently or measured directly (although there are many papers where it was inferred by seeing a covariation of other dependent variables). By contrast, we find an abundance of evidence showing cases in which changes in the activities of named and genetically identified transporters led to measurable changes in the rate or extent of drug uptake. PBIN also has considerable predictive power, and accounts readily for the large differences in drug uptake between tissues, cells and species, in accounting for the metabolite-likeness of marketed drugs, in pharmacogenomics, and in providing a straightforward explanation for the late-stage appearance of toxicity and of lack of efficacy during drug discovery programmes despite macroscopically adequate pharmacokinetics. Consequently, the view that Phospholipid Bilayer diffusion Is Negligible (PBIN) provides a starting hypothesis for assessing cellular drug uptake that is much better supported by the available evidence, and is both more productive and more predictive.","[Kell, Douglas B.] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Kell, Douglas B.] Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Oliver, Stephen G.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge CB2 1QW, England; [Oliver, Stephen G.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Syst Biol Ctr, Cambridge, England","Kell, DB (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester Inst Biotechnol, 131 Princess St, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England.",dbk@manchester.ac.uk,"Kell, Douglas/E-8318-2011","Kell, Douglas/0000-0001-5838-7963",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB1D00774711]; Wellcome Trust/MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC)Wellcome Trust [0897031Z1091Z],We thank the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB1D00774711) for financial support.

One possible approach to this problem is the application of basin-hopping global optimization combined with an all-atom force field. In this work, the efficiency of basin-hopping is improved by introducing an approach that derives tertiary structures from the secondary structure assignments of individual residues. This approach is termed secondary-to-tertiary basin-hopping and benchmarked for three miniproteins: trpzip, trp-cage and ER-10. For each of the three miniproteins, the secondary-to-tertiary basin-hopping approach successfully and reliably predicts their three-dimensional structure. When it is applied to larger proteins, correctly folded structures are obtained. It can be concluded that the assembly of secondary structure elements using basin-hopping is a promising tool for de novo protein structure prediction.","[Strodel, Birgit] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Hoffmann, Falk; Kamat, Sanjay G.; Strodel, Birgit] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Complex Syst Struct Biochem, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Vancea, Ioan] DESY, European Mol Biol Lab, D-22603 Hamburg, Germany","Strodel, B (corresponding author), Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",b.strodel@fz-juelich.de,"Hoffmann, Falk/P-7996-2018; Strodel, Birgit/H-5449-2013","Hoffmann, Falk/0000-0003-0426-4954; Strodel, Birgit/0000-0002-8734-7765",RWTH Compute Cluster in Aachen [JARA0018],F.H. and B.

Approaches to this problem typically involve varied compromises to this problem typically involve varied compromised between accuracy, precision, and cost; the goal here is to address whether simple implict solvent models have become sufficiently accurate for their weaknesses to be offset by their ability to rapidly provide much more precise conformational data as compared to explicit solvent. We demonstrate that our recently developed physics-based model simulated folding for 16 of 17 proteins with a variety of sizes, secondary structure, and topologies. The simulations were carried out using the Amber software on inexpensive GPUs, providing similar to mu s/day per GPU, and >2.5 ms data presented here.

However, finding even a single pathway, with the detail chronicling of intermediates, is an arduous task. In this work we explore the free energy surface of unfolding pathway through umbrella sampling, for a small globular a-helical protein chicken-villin headpiece (HP-36) when the melting of secondary structures is induced by adding DMSO in aqueous solution. We find that the unfolding proceeds through the initial separation or melting of aggregated hydrophobic core that comprises of three phenylalanine residues (Phe7, Phe11, and Phe18). This separation is accompanied by simultaneous melting of the second helix. Unfolding is found to be a multistage process involving crossing of three consecutive minima and two barriers at the initial stage. At a molecular level, Phe18 is observed to reorient itself towards other hydrophobic grooves to stabilize the intermediate states. We identify the configuration of the intermediates and correlate the intermediates with those obtained in our previous works. We also give an estimate of the barriers for different transition states and observe the softening of the barriers with increasing DMSO concentration. We show that higher concentration of DMSO tunes the unfolding pathway by destabilizing the third minimum and stabilizing the second one, indicating the development of a solvent modified, less rugged pathway. The prime outcome of this work is the demonstration that mixed solvents can profoundly transform the nature of the energy landscape and induce unfolding via a modified route. A successful application of Kramer's rate equation correlating the free energy simulation results shows faster rate of unfolding with increasing DMSO concentration. This work perhaps presents the first systematic theoretical study of the effect of a chemical denaturant on the microscopic free energy surface and rates of unfolding of HP-36.

Here, we present a general analytical method for constructing dynamical free-energy landscapes of helices. Such landscapes contain information about the thermodynamic stabilities of the possible macromolecular conformations, as well as about the dynamic connectivity, thus enabling the visualization and computation of folding pathways and timescales. We elucidate the methodology using the folding of polyalanine, and demonstrate that its alpha-helix folding kinetics is dominated by misfolded intermediates. At the physiological temperature of T = 298 K and midfolding time t = 250 ns, the fraction of structures in the native-state (alpha-helical) basin equals 22%, which is in good agreement with time-resolved experiments and massively distributed, ensemble-convergent molecular-dynamics simulations.

Because of their large extinction coefficients and quantum yields, synthetic heteroaromatic chromophores covalently linked to the protein are often used as donor and acceptor fluorophores. A key issue in the interpretation of such experiments is the extent to which the properties of the unfolded chain may be affected by the presence of these chromophores. In this article, we investigate this question using all-atom explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of three different unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins. We find that the secondary structure and long-range contacts are largely the same in the presence or absence of the fluorophores, and that the dimensions of the chain with and without chromophores are similar. This suggests that, at least in the cases studied, extrinsic fluorophores have little effect on the structural properties of unfolded or disordered proteins. We also find that the critical FRET orientational factor kappa(2), has an average value and equilibrium distribution very close to that expected for isotropic orientations, which supports one of the assumptions frequently made when interpreting FRET efficiency in terms of distances.","[Zerze, Guel H.; Mittal, Jeetain] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Best, Robert B.] Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA","Mittal, J (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",jeetain@lehigh.edu,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1120399, TG-MCB-120014]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant No. CBET-1120399 (to J.M.).

To understand such an elusive phenomenon, it is necessary to thoroughly survey the large configurational space from the stable complex structure to the dissociated states using the all-atom model in explicit solvent and to delineate the energy landscape of protein-protein interactions. In this study, we carried out a multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) simulation of the formation of a barnase-barstar complex, which is a protein complex characterized by an extraordinary tight and fast binding, to determine the energy landscape of atomistic protein-protein interactions. The MSES adopts a multicopy and multiscale scheme to enable for the enhanced sampling of the all-atom model of large proteins including explicit solvent. During the 100-ns MSES simulation of the barnase-barstar system, we observed the association-dissociation processes of the atomistic protein complex in solution several times, which contained not only the native complex structure but also fully non-native configurations. The sampled distributions suggest that a large variety of non-native states went downhill to the stable complex structure, like a fast folding on a funnel-like potential. This funnel landscape is attributed to dominant configurations in the early stage of the association process characterized by near-native orientations, which will accelerate the native inter-molecular interactions. These configurations are guided mostly by the shape complementarity between barnase and barstar, and lead to the fast formation of the final complex structure along the downhill energy landscape.","[Moritsugu, Kei; Terada, Tohru; Kidera, Akinori] RIKEN, Computat Sci Res Program, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Moritsugu, Kei; Kidera, Akinori] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 232, Japan; [Terada, Tohru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Moritsugu, K (corresponding author), RIKEN, Computat Sci Res Program, Wako, Saitama, Japan.",moritugu@tsurumi.yokohama-cu.ac.jp,"Terada, Tohru/W-2956-2019","Terada, Tohru/0000-0002-7091-0646","MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [25840060, 23247027]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25840060, 23247027] Funding Source: KAKEN","This research was supported by MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists, 25840060 (KM) and MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research, 23247027 (AK).

Over a large dataset, 1876 values of Delta Delta G of folding, the RMSD is 1.34 kcal/mol. Using an alternative measure of accuracy, either the sign of the calculated Delta Delta G agrees with experiment or the absolute value of the deviation is less than 1.0 kcal/mol, 1660 of 1876 data points (88.5%) pass the condition. Relative to models used previously in computer-aided protein design, the concept, we propose, most responsible for the performance of our model, and for the extensibility to non-neutral values of pH, is the treatment of electrostatic energy. The electronic structure of the protein is modeled using distributed atomic multipoles. The structured liquid state of the solvent is modeled using a dielectric continuum. A modification to the energetics of the reaction field, induced by the protein in the dielectric continuum, attempts to account for preformed multipoles of solvent water molecules and ions. An adjustable weight (with optimal value. 141) applied to the total vacuum energy accounts implicitly for electronic polarization. A threshold distance, beyond which pairwise atomic interactions are neglected, is not used. In searches through subspaces of sequences and conformations, efficiency remains acceptable for useful applications.

Here, we aim for something even better. We try to combine mathematical physics and biology into a picoscope of life. For this, we merge techniques that were introduced and developed in modern mathematical physics, largely by Ludvig Faddeev, to describe objects such as solitons and Higgs and to explain phenomena such as anomalies in gauge fields. We propose a synthesis that can help to resolve the protein folding problem, one of the most important conundrums in all of science. We apply the concept of gauge invariance to scrutinize the extrinsic geometry of strings in three-dimensional space. We evoke general principles of symmetry in combination with Wilsonian universality and derive an essentially unique Landau-Ginzburg energy that describes the dynamics of a generic stringlike configuration in the far infrared. We observe that the energy supports topological solitons that relate to an anomaly similarly to how a string is framed around its inflection points. We explain how the solitons operate as modular building blocks from which folded proteins are composed. We describe crystallographic protein structures by multisolitons with experimental precision and investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of proteins under temperature variations. We simulate the folding process of a protein at in vivo speed and with close to picoscale accuracy using a standard laptop computer. With picobiology as next pursuit of mathematical physics, things can only get better.","[Niemi, A. J.] Univ Tours, CNRS, Lab Math & Phys Theor, UMR, Tours, France; [Niemi, A.

It enables the application of pair potentials to length and time scales that were previously out of scope for molecular dynamics simulation. With an efficient dynamic load balancing scheme, it delivers high scalability even for challenging heterogeneous configurations. Presently, multicenter rigid potential models based on Lennard-Jones sites, point charges, and higher-order polarities are supported. Due to its modular design, ls1 mardyn can be extended to new physical models, methods, and algorithms, allowing future users to tailor it to suit their respective needs.

In this study, we report PEP-FOLD2, an improved coarse grained approach for peptide de novo structure prediction and compare it with PEP-FOLD I and the state-of-the-art Rosetta program. Using a benchmark of 56 structurally diverse peptides with 25-52 amino acids and a total of 600 simulations for each system, PEP-FOLD2 generates higher quality models than PEP-FOLD1, and PEP-FOLD2 and Rosetta generate near-native or native models for 95% and 88% of the targets, respectively. In the situation where we do not have any experimental structures at hand, PEP-FOLD2 and Rosetta return a near-native or native conformation among the top five best scored models for 80% and 75% of the targets, respectively. While the PEP-FOLD2 prediction rate is better than the ROSETTA prediction rate by 5%, this improvement is non-negligible because PEP-FOLD2 explores a larger conformational space than ROSETTA and consists of a single coarse-grained phase. Our results indicate that if the coarse-grained PEP-FOLD2 method is approaching maturity, we are not at the end of the game of mini-protein structure prediction, but this opens new perspectives for large-scale in silico experiments.","[Shen, Yimin; Tuffery, Pierre] MTi, INSERM, U973, F-75205 Paris, France; [Maupetit, Julien; Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Biol Physicochim, Lab Biochim Theor, CNRS, UPR 9080, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France; [Shen, Yimin; Maupetit, Julien; Derreumaux, Philippe; Tuffery, Pierre] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris, France","Tuffery, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, INSERM, UMR S 973, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75205 Paris, France.",pierre.tuffery@univ-paris-diderot.fr,"Tuffery, Pierre/L-6953-2017; Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019","Tuffery, Pierre/0000-0003-1033-9895; Maupetit, Julien/0000-0001-6285-6646",,,,57,215,215,4,37,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Here we determine the kinetics and energetics of a disordered protein domain the kinase-inducible domain (KID) of the transcription factor CREB and that of its phosphorylated form pKID, using high-throughput molecular dynamic simulations. We identify the presence of a metastable, partially ordered state with a 60-fold slowdown in conformational kinetics that arises due to phosphorylation, kinetically stabilizing residues known to participate in an early binding intermediate. We show that this effect is only partially reconstituted by mutation to glutamate, indicating that the phosphate is uniquely required for the long-lived state to arise.

NMR relaxation studies using probes that only achieve large chemical shift difference from unfolded values on complete cage formation indicate slower folding in some but not all cases. Fourteen species have been examined, with cage formation time constants (1/k(F)) ranging from 0.97.5 mu s at 300 K. The present study does not change the status of the Trp-cage as a fast folding, essentially two-state system, although it does alter the stage at which this description applies. A diversity of prestructuring events, depending on the specific analogue examined, may appear in the folding scenario, but in all cases, formation of the N-terminal helix is complete either at or before the cage-formation transition state. In contrast, the fold-stabilizing H-bonding interactions of the buried Ser14 side chain and the Arg/Asp salt bridge are post-transition state features on the folding pathway. The study has also found instances in which a [P12W] mutation is fold destabilizing but still serves to accelerate the folding process.","[Byrne, Aimee; Williams, D.

Until now it has not been reported that CLN025 can autonomously fold to its native conformation in a classical, all-atom, and isothermal-isobaric molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This article reports the autonomous and repeated folding of CLN025 from a fully extended backbone conformation to its native conformation in explicit solvent in multiple 500-ns MD simulations at 277 K and 1 atm with the first folding event occurring as early as 66.1 ns. These simulations were accomplished by using AMBER forcefield derivatives with atomic masses reduced by 10-fold on Apple Mac Pros. By contrast, no folding event was observed when the simulations were repeated using the original AMBER forcefields of FF12SB and FF14SB. The results demonstrate that low-mass MD simulation is a simple and generic technique to enhance configurational sampling. This technique may propel autonomous folding of a wide range of miniature proteins in classical, all-atom, and isothermal-isobaric MD simulations performed on commodity computers an important step forward in quantitative biology.

We show that the total number of hydrogen bonds in the system does not change significantly during aggregation. This emerges from a compensatory mechanism where the formation of one interpeptide hydrogen bond requires rupture of two peptide water bonds, leading to the formation of one extra water-water bond. Since hydrogen bonds are mostly electrostatic in nature, this mechanism implies that electrostatic energies related to these bonds are not minimized during fibril formation. Therefore, hydrogen bonds do not drive fibrillization in all-atom models. Nevertheless, they play an important role in this process since aggregation without the formation of interpeptide hydrogen bonds accounts for a prohibitively large electrostatic penalty (similar to 9.4 kJ/mol). Our work also highlights the importance of using accurate models to describe chemical bonds since Lennard-Jones and electrostatic contributions of different chemical groups of the protein and solvent are 1 order of magnitude larger than the overall enthalpy of the system. Thus, small errors in modeling these interactions can produce large errors in the total enthalpy of the system.","[Su, Zhaoqian; Dias, Cristiano L.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Newark, NJ 07102 USA","Dias, CL (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Phys, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",cld@njit.edu,"Su, Zhaoqian/ABC-2107-2020; su, zhaoqian/AAA-6487-2020","su, zhaoqian/0000-0002-8369-0697",,,,87,12,12,0,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

However, simply generating a long trajectory is insufficient, as researchers must be able to transform the data in a simulation trajectory into specific scientific insights. Although this analysis step has often been taken for granted, it deserves further attention as large-scale simulations become increasingly routine. In this perspective, we discuss the application of Markov models to the analysis of large-scale biomolecular simulations. We draw attention to recent improvements in the construction of these models as well as several important open issues.

The profile is supplemented by a trace of the temporal evolution of the system highlighting the sequence of events. We demonstrate that the resultant SAPPHIRE (States And Pathways Projected with HIgh REsolution) plots provide a comprehensive picture of the thermodynamics and kinetics of complex, molecular systems exhibiting dynamics covering a range of time and length scales. Information on pathways connecting states and the level of recurrence are quickly inferred from the visualisation. The considerable advantages of our approach are speed and resolution: the SAPPHIRE plot is scalable to very large data sets and represents every single snapshot.

Hence, it is particularly worthwhile to investigate the lifetime and stability of representative molecular-clusters of two polymorphic forms of PABA in aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations of 5 ns duration in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (constant particle number, pressure and temperature (NPT) ensemble) were performed for the two polymorphic forms at three different temperatures 0 degrees C, 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C. The simulations revealed that at 0 degrees C the representative molecular-clusters of the two polymorphic forms remain ordered while at 50 degrees C the molecular packing within the clusters becomes partially disordered for both polymorphic forms and at 100 degrees C the clusters lose long-range order rapidly and come to resemble liquid drops. Care should be taken when assessing the relative stability of polymorphic forms, as a function of temperature, from such computational experiments which explore the dissolution of nano-scale crystals. The long range order of the clusters of the alpha-form at 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C was, respectively, partially and completely lost after 5 ns which merits further investigation given that the a-form is the high-temperature stable polymorph. Importantly, the initial shape of clusters, as well as the number of solute molecules they contained, affected the extent to which order was lost and how rapidly the loss occurred. Given that the classical nucleation theory predicts a finite probability that clusters significantly larger than the critical size, in terms of number of molecules, may dissolve, building clusters containing a greater number of molecules could improve the simulated stability of the alpha polymorph at 50 degrees C and 100 degrees C. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the selection of a suitable electrostatic potential is very important for the description of the dissolution process of the nano-sized crystals.

Notwithstanding the ever-increasing power of high performance computers current MD simulations face several challenges: the fastest atomic movements require time steps of a few femtoseconds which are small compared to biomolecular relevant timescales of milliseconds or even seconds for large conformational motions. At the same time, scalability to a large number of cores is limited mostly due to long-range interactions. An appealing alternative to atomic-level simulations is coarse-graining the resolution of the system or reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian to improve sampling while decreasing computational costs. Native structure-based models, also called Go-type models, are based on energy landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration. They have been tremendously successful in explaining fundamental questions of, e.g., protein folding, RNA folding or protein function. At the same time, they are computationally sufficiently inexpensive to run complex simulations on smaller computing systems or even commodity hardware. Still, their setup and evaluation is quite complex even though sophisticated software packages support their realization. Results: Here, we establish an efficient infrastructure for native structure-based models to support the community and enable high-throughput simulations on remote computing resources via GridBeans and UNICORE middleware. This infrastructure organizes the setup of such simulations resulting in increased comparability of simulation results. At the same time, complete workflows for advanced simulation protocols can be established and managed on remote resources by a graphical interface which increases reusability of protocols and additionally lowers the entry barrier into such simulations for, e.g., experimental scientists who want to compare their results against simulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach by illustrating it for protein folding simulations for a range of proteins. Conclusions: We present software enhancing the entire workflow for native structure-based simulations including exception-handling and evaluations. Extending the capability and improving the accessibility of existing simulation packages the software goes beyond the state of the art in the domain of biomolecular simulations. Thus we expect that it will stimulate more individuals from the community to employ more confidently modeling in their research.","[Lutz, Benjamin; Sinner, Claude; Bozic, Stefan; Kondov, Ivan; Schug, Alexander] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Lutz, Benjamin; Sinner, Claude] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Dept Phys, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany","Kondov, I (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Steinbuch Ctr Comp, Hermann von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany.",ivan.kondov@kit.edu,,,Impuls- und Vernetzungfonds of the Helmholtz Association; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [RI-261594],"A.S. acknowledges support from the Impuls- und Vernetzungfonds of the Helmholtz Association.

The simulations faithfully and accurately reproduce the major experimental findings and show that (a) the native peptide is mostly disordered in solution, (b) the mutant peptide has a well-defined and stable structure, and (c) the structure of the mutant is an irregular beta-hairpin with a non-glycine beta-bulge, in excellent agreement with the peptide's known NMR structure. Additionally, the simulations also predict the presence of a very small beta-hairpin-like population for the native peptide but surprisingly indicate that this population is structurally more similar to the structure of the native peptide as observed in the vammin protein than to the NMR structure of the isolated mutant peptide.

Unfolded states can be populated under strongly denaturing conditions, but the ensemble which is relevant for folding, stability, and aggregation is that populated under physiological conditions. Characterization of nonnative states is critical for the understanding of these processes, yet comparatively little is known about their energetics and their structural propensities under native conditions. The standard view is that energetically significant coupled interactions involving multiple residues are generally not present in the denatured state ensemble (DSE) or in intrinsically disordered proteins. Using the N-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9, a small alpha-beta protein, as an experimental model system, we demonstrate that networks of energetically significant, coupled interactions can form in the DSE of globular proteins, and can involve residues that are distant in sequence and spatially well separated in the native structure. X-ray crystallography, NMR, dynamics studies, native state pK(a) measurements, and thermodynamic analysis of more than 25 mutants demonstrate that residues are energetically coupled in the DSE. Altering these interactions by mutation affects the stability of the domain. Mutations that alter the energetics of the DSE can impact the analysis of cooperativity and folding, and may play a role in determining the propensity to aggregate.","[Cho, Jae-Hyun] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Meng, Wenli; Sato, Satoshi; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Kim, Eun Young] SUNY Stony Brook, Struct Biol Ctr, Dept Biochem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Schindelin, Hermann] Univ Wurzburg, Rudolf Virchow Ctr Expt Biomed, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany; [Schindelin, Hermann] Univ Wurzburg, Inst Biol Struct, D-97080 Wurzburg, Germany","Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",daniel.raleigh@stonybrook.edu,"Schindelin, Hermann/Q-2697-2019","Cho, Jae-Hyun/0000-0002-6190-6151; raleigh, daniel/0000-0003-3248-7493",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1330259],This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grant MCB-1330259 (to D.P.R.).,,51,31,31,0,25,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

However, the driving forces behind this cooperativity are poorly understood. The present work shows that the cooperativity of helix formation in the acetyl-(AAQAA)(3)-NH2 Peptide is significantly enhanced using an empirical force field that explicitly includes the treatment of electronic polarizability. Polarizable simulations yield helical content consistent with experimental measurements and indicate that the dependence of helical content on temperature is improved over additive models, though further sampling is required to fully validate this conclusion. Cooperativity is indicated by the peptide sampling either the coiled state or long helices with relatively low populations of short helices. The cooperativity is shown to be associated with enhanced dipole moments of the peptide backbone upon helix formation. These results indicate the polarizable force field to more accurately model peptide-folding cooperativity based on its physically realistic treatment of electronic polarizability.","[Huang, Jing; MacKerell, Alexander D., Jr.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","MacKerell, AD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",alex@outerbanks.umaryland.edu,"Huang, Jing/G-5320-2011; MacKerell, Alex/AAA-2560-2020; MacKerell, Alex/Y-2469-2019","Huang, Jing/0000-0001-9639-2907; MacKerell, Alex/0000-0001-8287-6804","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM051501, GM072558]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-1053575]; SNSF Fellowship [PBBSP2_144301]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R29GM051501, R01GM072558, R29GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM072558, R29GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM072558, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM072558, R29GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM051501, R29GM051501, R01GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM051501, R01GM072558, R01GM072558, R01GM072558, R01GM051501, R01GM072558] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [0910847] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Financial support from the NIH (GM051501 and GM072558) and computational support from the University of Maryland Computer-Aided Drug Design Center, and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by National Science Foundation grant number OCI-1053575, are acknowledged.

In this paper, we report a new sampling method that utilizes a few collective modes obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) to guide the MD simulations. Two multidomain proteins, bacteriophage T4 lysozyme and human vinculin, are studied to test the method. By updating the PCA modes with a proper frequency, our method can sample large-amplitude conformational changes of the proteins much more efficiently than standard MD. Since those PCA modes are calculated from structural ensembles generated by all-atom simulations, the method may overcome an inherent limitation called tip effect that would possibly appear in those sampling techniques based on coarse-grained elastic network models. The algorithm proposed here is potentially very useful in developing tools for flexible fitting of protein structures integrating cryo-electron microscope or small-angle X-ray scattering data.","[Zhang, Zhiyong] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZY (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei Natl Lab Phys Sci Microscale, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",zzyzhang@ustc.edu.cn,,"Peng, Junhui/0000-0003-2855-2299","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31270760]; National Key Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB910203]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB08030102]; Anhui Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1208085MC38]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WK2070000017, WK2070000020]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 31270760), National Key Basic Research Program of China (grant 2013CB910203), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant XDB08030102), Anhui Natural Science Foundation (grant 1208085MC38), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2070000017, WK2070000020).",,92,20,20,2,36,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Current atomically detailed force fields are not accurate enough to capture the properties of even simple nucleic acid constructs. In this article, we review our efforts to develop coarse-grained (CG) models that capture the underlying physics for the particular length scale of interest. Two models are discussed. One of them is the three interaction site (TIS) model, in which each nucleotide is represented by three beads corresponding to sugar, phosphate, and base. The other is the self-organized polymer (SOP) model, in which each nucleotide is represented as a single interaction center. Applications of the TIS model to study the complexity of hairpin formation and the effects of crowding in a shifting equilibrium between two conformations in human telomerase pseudoknot are described. The work on crowding illustrates a direct link to the activity of telomerase. We use the SOP model to describe the response of the Tetrahymena ribozyme to force. The simulated unfolding pathways agree well with single molecule pulling experiments. We also review predictions for the unfolding pathways for the Azoarcus ribozyme. The success of the CG applications to describe dynamics in RNA gives hope that more complex processes involving RNA-protein interactions can be tackled using variants of the proposed models.","[Hyeon, Changbong] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Denesyuk, Natalia A.; Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, Biophys Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Hyeon, C (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",hyeoncb@kias.re.kr,"Hyeon, Changbong/H-3295-2011","Hyeon, Changbong/0000-0002-4844-7237",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE09-10433],This work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (CHE09-10433) (D.

Such unfolding complexity is due to the weak thermodynamic coupling that exists between the various structural segments of these proteins, and it is manifested in unfolding curves that differ depending on the structural probe employed to monitor the process. Probe-dependent unfolding has important practical implications because it permits one to investigate the folding energy landscape in detail using multiprobe thermodynamic experiments. This type of thermodynamic behavior has been investigated in depth on the protein BBL, an example of extreme (one-state) downhill folding in which there is no free energy barrier at any condition, including the denaturation midpoint. However, an open question is, to what extent is such thermodynamic behavior observed on less extreme downhill folders? Here we perform a multiprobe spectroscopic characterization of the microsecond folder PDD, a structural and functional homologue of BBL that folds within the downhill regime, but is not an example of one-state downhill folding; rather at the denaturation midpoint PDD folds by crossing an incipient free energy barrier. Model-free analysis of the unfolding curves from four different spectroscopic probes together with differential scanning calorimetry reveals a dispersion of similar to 9 K in the apparent melting temperature and also marked differences in unfolding broadness (from similar to 50 to similar to 130 kJ mol(-1) when analyzed with a two-state model), confirming that such properties are also observed on less extreme downhill folders. We subsequently perform a global quantitative analysis of the unfolding data of PDD using the same ME statistical mechanical model that was used before for the BBL domain. The analysis shows that this simple model captures all of the features observed on the unfolding of PDD (i.e., the intensity and temperature dependence of the different spectroscopic signals). From the model we estimate a free energy landscape for PDD in which the maximal thermodynamic barrier (i.e., at the denaturation midpoint) is only similar to 0.5 RT, consistent with previous independent estimates. Our results highlight that multiprobe unfolding experiments in equilibrium combined with statistical mechanical modeling provide important insights into the structural events that take place during the unfolding process of downhill proteins, and thus effectively probe the free energy landscape of these proteins.","[Naganathan, Athi N.; Munoz, Victor] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Naganathan, Athi N.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Madrid 28049, Spain","Naganathan, AN (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",athi@iitm.ac.in; vmunoz@cnb.csic.es,,"Naganathan, Athi N/0000-0002-1655-7802","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSD2009-00088, BIO2011-28092]",This work was funded through grants CSD2009-00088 and BIO2011-28092 (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness).,,76,26,27,0,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

These domains are versatile and can perform a wide range of functions. Many of these domains readily unfold on disulfide bond reduction, suggesting that in the absence of covalent bonding they might display significant disorder. Results: Here, we analyzed the degree of disorder in 97 domains representative of the different DRDs families and demonstrate that, in terms of sequence, many of them can be classified as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or contain predicted disordered regions. The analysis of the aggregation propensity of these domains indicates that, similar to IDPs, their sequences are more soluble and have less aggregating regions than those of other globular domains, suggesting that they might have evolved to avoid aggregation after protein synthesis and before they can attain its compact and covalently linked native structure. Innovation and Conclusion: DRDs, which resemble IDPs in the reduced state and become globular when their disulfide bonds are formed, illustrate the link between protein folding and aggregation propensities and how these two properties cannot be easily dissociated, determining the main traits of the folding routes followed by these small proteins to attain their native oxidized states.","[Fraga, Hugo; Grana-Montes, Ricardo; Illa, Ricard; Covaleda, Giovanni; Ventura, Salvador] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Inst Biotecnol & Biomed, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain","Ventura, S (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Inst Biotecnol & Biomed, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",salvador.ventura@uab.es,"Covaleda Cortes, Giovanni/D-1575-2018; Ventura, Salvador/C-7021-2008; Fraga, Hugo/X-4850-2019","Covaleda Cortes, Giovanni/0000-0002-7621-852X; Ventura, Salvador/0000-0002-9652-6351; Fraga, Hugo/0000-0001-7677-4086; Grana-Montes, Ricardo/0000-0003-1932-1077",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain)Spanish Government [BFU2010-14901]; AGAUR (Generalitat de Catalunya)Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)Generalitat de Catalunya [2009-SGR-760]; ICREAICREA,This work was supported by grants BFU2010-14901 from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Spain) and 2009-SGR-760 from AGAUR (Generalitat de Catalunya).

The approach is based on the recently proposed most probable path algorithm which identifies the metastable states of the system, combined with dynamical coring of these states in order to obtain a consistent Markov state model. The method facilitates the construction of a dendrograrn associated with the folding free-energy landscape of HP35, which reveals a hierarchical funnel structure and shows that the native state is rather a kinetic trap than a network hub. The energy landscape of HP35 consists of the entropic unfolded basin U, where the prestructuring of the protein takes place, the intermediate basin 1, which is connected to U via the rate-limiting U -> I transition state reflecting the formation of helix-1, and the native basin N, containing a state close to the NMR structure and a native-like state that exhibits enhanced fluctuations of helix-3. The model is in line with recent experimental observations that the intermediate and native states differ mostly in their dynamics (locked vs unlocked states). Employing dihedral angle principal component analysis, subdiffusive motion on a multidimensional free-energy surface is found.","[Stock, Gerhard] Univ Freiburg, Inst Phys, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany; Univ Freiburg, Freiburg Inst Adv Studies FRIAS, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Stock, G (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Inst Phys, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",stock@physik.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,63,20,20,2,25,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,1520-5207,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

We show, using simulations of src SH3 domain, that mechanical force enhances the population of the aggregation-prone (N*) states, which are rarely populated under force free native conditions but are encoded in the spectrum of native fluctuations. The folding phase diagrams of SH3 as a function of denaturant concentration ([C]), mechanical force (f), and temperature exhibit an apparent two-state behavior, without revealing the presence of the elusive N* states. Interestingly, the phase boundaries separating the folded and unfolded states at all [C] and f fall on a master curve, which can be quantitatively described using an analogy to superconductors in a magnetic field. The free energy profiles as a function of the molecular extension (R), which are accessible in pulling experiments, (R), reveal the presence of a native-like N* with a disordered solvent-exposed amino-terminal beta-strand. The structure of the N* state is identical with that found in Fyn SH3 by NMR dispersion experiments. We show that the timescale for fibril formation can be estimated from the population of the N* state, determined by the free energy gap separating the native structure and the N* state, a finding that can be used to assess fibril forming tendencies of proteins. The structures of the N* state are used to show that oligomer formation and likely route to fibrils occur by a domain-swap mechanism in SH3 domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have suggested that burials, as expressed by atomic distances to the molecular center, are sufficiently informative for structural determination while potentially obtainable from sequences. Here we provide direct evidence for this distinctive role of burials in the folding code, demonstrating that burial propensities estimated from local sequence can indeed be used to fold globular proteins in ab initio simulations. We have used a statistical scheme based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to classify all heavy atoms of a protein into a small number of burial atomic types depending on sequence context. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed with a potential that forces all atoms of each type towards their predicted burial level, while simple geometric constraints were imposed on covalent structure and hydrogen bond formation. The correct folded conformation was obtained and distinguished in simulations that started from extended chains for a selection of structures comprising all three folding classes and high burial prediction quality. These results demonstrate that atomic burials can act as informational intermediates between sequence and structure, providing a new conceptual framework for improving structural prediction and understanding the fundamentals of protein folding.

In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different reweighting algorithms including the exponential average, Maclaurin series, and cumulant expansion on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, chignolin, and Trp-cage. Exponential average reweighting can recover the original free energy profiles easily only when the distribution of the boost potential is narrow (e.g., the range <= 20k(B)T) as found in dihedral-boost aMD simulation of alanine dipeptide. In dual-boost aMD simulations of the studied systems, exponential average generally leads to high energetic fluctuations, largely due to the fact that the Boltzmann reweighting factors are dominated by a very few high boost potential frames. In comparison, reweighting based on Maclaurin series expansion (equivalent to cumulant expansion on the first order) greatly suppresses the energetic noise but often gives incorrect energy minimum positions and significant errors at the energy barriers (similar to 2-3k(B)T). Finally, reweighting using cumulant expansion to the second order is able to recover the most accurate free energy profiles within statistical errors of similar to KBT particularly when the distribution of the boost potential exhibits low anharmonicity (i.e., near-Gaussian distribution), and should be of wide applicability.

Numerous computational models and methods have been developed for studying structure formation at the atomic level. Due to its small size and simple structure, deca-alanine is used as a model system in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The free energy of unfolding in vacuum has been studied extensively using the end-to-end distance of the peptide as the reaction coordinate. However, few studies have been conducted in the presence of explicit solvent. Previous results show a significant decrease in the free energy of extended conformations in water, but the alpha-helical state is still notably favored over the extended state. Although sufficient in vacuum, we show that end-to-end distance is incapable of capturing the full complexity of deca-alanine folding in water. Using alpha-helical content as a second reaction coordinate, we deduce a more descriptive free-energy landscape, one which reveals a second energy minimum in the extended conformations that is of comparable free energy to the a-helical state. Equilibrium simulations demonstrate the relative stability of the extended and alpha-helical states in water as well as the transition between the two states. This work reveals both the necessity and challenge of determining a proper reaction coordinate to fully characterize a given process.","[Hazel, Anthony; Gumbart, James C.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chipot, Christophe] CNRS, Lab Associe Int, Unite Mixte Rech, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Gumbart, JC (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",gumbart@physics.gatech.edu,,"Hazel, Anthony/0000-0002-8195-7909","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [K22-AI100927]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-1053575]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [K22AI100927, K22AI100927] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors thank Mahmoud Moradi for stimulating discussions and helpful insights.

However, a significant shortcoming is the difficulty to fit the Ramachandran plots of all AA residues simultaneously, affecting the accuracy of the force field. In this Feature Article, we report a new strategy for protein force field parametrization. Backbone and side-chain conformational distributions of all 20 AA residues obtained from protein coil library were used as the target data. The dihedral angle (torsion) potentials and some local nonbonded (1-4/1-5/1-6) interactions in OPLS-AA/L force field were modified such that the target data can be excellently reproduced by molecular dynamics simulations of dipeptides (blocked AAs) in explicit water, resulting in a new force field with AA-specific parameters, RSFF1. An efficient free energy decomposition approach was developed to separate the corrections on phi and psi from the two-dimensional Ramachandran plots. RSFF1 is shown to reproduce the experimental NMR (3)J-coupling constants of AA dipeptides better than other force fields. It has a good balance between alpha-helical and beta-sheet secondary structures. It can successfully fold a set of alpha-helix proteins (Trp-cage and Homeodomain) and beta-hairpins (Trpzip-2, GB1 hairpin), which cannot be consistently stabilized by other state-of-the-art force fields. Interestingly, the RSFF1 force field systematically overestimates the melting temperature (and the stability of native state) of these peptides/proteins. It has a potential application in the simulation of protein folding and protein structure refinement.","[Jiang, Fan; Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chen-Yang; Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Coll Chem, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Jiang, F (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",jiangfan@pku.edu.cn; wuyd@pkusz.edu.cn,"Wu, Yun-Dong/G-8463-2013; Jiang, Fan/E-2771-2012",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21133002, 21203004]; Shenzhen Peacock Program [KQTD201103]; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School","We are grateful for the financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21133002 for Y.-D.W. and 21203004 for F.J.), the Shenzhen Peacock Program (KQTD201103), and Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School.",,86,55,56,2,57,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

This approach has enabled us to reach convergence in the free energy landscape calculations, obtaining an ensemble of structures in relatively accurate agreement with independent experimental data used for validation. By observing at atomistic resolution the transient formation of native and non-native structures in this acid-denatured state of ACBP, we rationalize the effects of single-point mutations on the folding rate, stability, and transition-state structures of this protein, thus characterizing the role of the unfolded state in determining the folding process.","[Camilloni, Carlo; Vendruscolo, Michele] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Vendruscolo, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",mv245@cam.ac.uk,"Vendruscolo, Michele/F-5901-2012; Camilloni, Carlo/A-4395-2009","Vendruscolo, Michele/0000-0002-3616-1610; Camilloni, Carlo/0000-0002-9923-8590",Marie Curie IEF FellowshipEuropean Union (EU); BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC),This study was supported by a Marie Curie IEF Fellowship (C.C.) and the BBSRC (M.V.).,,125,48,48,2,46,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Since this protein displays most essential features of protein structures in such a small size, this model protein can be an outstanding system for evaluating the balance in the propensity of the secondary structures and the quality of all-atom protein force fields. Particularly, this protein would be difficult to fold to its correct native structure without establishing proper balances between the secondary structure elements in all-atom energy functions. In this work, a series of the recently optimized five amber protein force fields [ff03*, ff99sb*-ildn, ff99sb-phi'-ildn, ff99sb-nmr1-ildn, ff99sb-Phi Psi(G24, CS)-ildn] were investigated for the simulations of 1FSD using a conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and a biased-exchange meta-dynamics (BEMD) methods. Among those tested force fields, we found that ff99sb-nmr1-ildn and ff99sb-Phi Psi(G24, CS)-ildn are promising in that both force fields can locate the native state of 1FSD with a high accuracy (backbone rmsd <= 1.7 angstrom) in the global free energy minimum basin with a reasonable energetics conforming to a previous circular dichroism (CD) experiment. Furthermore, both force fields led to a common set of two distinct folding pathways with a heterogeneous nature of the transition state to the folding. We anticipate that these force fields are reasonably well balanced, thereby transferable to many other protein folds.","[Yang, Changwon; Pak, Youngshang] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Chem, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Yang, Changwon; Pak, Youngshang] Pusan Natl Univ, Inst Funct Mat, Pusan 609735, South Korea; [Kim, Eunae] Chosun Univ, Coll Pharm, Kwangju 501759, South Korea","Pak, Y (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Chem, Pusan 609735, South Korea.",ypak@pusan.ac.kr,,,2-year Pusan National University Research Fund,YP acknowledges the financial support from 2-year Pusan National University Research Fund.,,41,3,3,0,18,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1229-5949,,,B KOREAN CHEM SOC,Bull.

Conformational dynamics are often inferred and quantified from the motional averaging of the NMR parameters. However, the nature of these motions is difficult to envision based only on spectroscopic data. Here, we utilized restrained molecular dynamics simulations to probe the structural dynamics, topology and conformational transitions of regulatory membrane proteins of the calcium ATPase SERCA, namely sarcolipin and phospholamban, in explicit lipid bilayers. Specifically, we employed oriented solid-state NMR data, such as dipolar couplings and chemical shift anisotropy measured in lipid bicelles, to refine the conformational ensemble of these proteins in lipid membranes. The samplings accurately reproduced the orientations of transmembrane helices and showed a significant degree of convergence with all of the NMR parameters. Unlike the unrestrained simulations, the resulting sarcolipin structures are in agreement with distances and angles for hydrogen bonds in ideal helices. In the case of phospholamban, the restrained ensemble sampled the conformational interconversion between T (helical) and R (unfolded) states for the cytoplasmic region that could not be observed using standard structural refinements with the same experimental data set. This study underscores the importance of implementing NMR data in molecular dynamics protocols to better describe the conformational landscapes of membrane proteins embedded in realistic lipid membranes.","[De Simone, Alfonso] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Mote, Kaustubh R.; Veglia, Gianluigi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Veglia, Gianluigi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biochem Mol Biol & Biophys, Minneapolis, MN USA","De Simone, A (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Life Sci, London, England.",adesimon@imperial.ac.uk; vegli001@umn.edu,,"Mote, Kaustubh/0000-0002-5151-3987","European Molecular Biology Organisation; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; National Institutes of Health grantUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM64742]; Minnesota Supercomputing Institute; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742, R01GM064742] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research has been supported by the European Molecular Biology Organisation and the Leverhulme Trust (AD.), and by a National Institutes of Health grant (GM64742 to G.V.). and by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.",,103,13,13,0,19,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

The use of integrated-tempering-sampling molecular dynamics simulations achieves reversible folding and unfolding events in individual short trajectories, which thus provides an efficient approach to sufficiently sample the configuration space of protein and delineate the folding pathway of a-helix bundle. The detailed free energy landscape analyses indicate that the folding mechanism of alpha-helix bundle is not uniform but sequence dependent. A simple model is then proposed to predict folding mechanism of a-helix bundle on the basis of amino acid composition: alpha-helical proteins containing higher percentage of hydrophobic residues than charged ones fold via nucleation- condensation mechanism (e.g., alpha D-3 and BdpA) whereas proteins having opposite tendency in amino acid composition more likely fold via the framework mechanism (e.g., alpha W-3). The model is tested on various alpha-helix bundle proteins, and the predicted mechanism is similar to the most approved one for each protein. In addition, the common features in the folding pathway of alpha-helix bundle protein are also deduced. In summary, the present study provides comprehensive, atomic-level picture of the folding of alpha-helix bundle proteins.","Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin [TG-MCB110130],We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 21373258) and National Basic Research Program (Grant 2014CB910400) for financial support.

Here, we alter the solvent environment in a controlled manner by choosing two different cosolvents of water, urea, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and study unfolding of four different proteins to understand the respective sequence of melting by computer simulation methods. We indeed find interesting differences in the sequence of melting of alpha helices and beta sheets in these two solvents. For example, in 8 M urea solution, beta-sheet parts of a protein are found to unfold preferentially, followed by the unfolding of alpha helices. In contrast, 8 M DMSO solution unfolds alpha helices first, followed by the separation of beta sheets for the majority of proteins. Sequence of unfolding events in four different alpha/beta proteins and also in chicken villin head piece (HP-36) both in urea and DMSO solutions demonstrate that the unfolding pathways are determined jointly by relative exposure of polar and nonpolar residues of a protein and the mode of molecular action of a solvent on that protein.","[Roy, Susmita; Bagchi, Biman] Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Bagchi, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",bbagchi@sscu.iisc.ernet.in,,"BAGCHI, BIMAN/0000-0002-7146-5994","DST, IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India)","We thank Rikhia Ghosh for many useful discussions.

Before it folds into a stable conformation, or after unfolding from a stable conformation, the protein will generally stray from one random conformation to another leading thus to rapid fluctuations. Brief structural changes therefore occur before folding and unfolding events. These short-lived movements are easily overlooked in studies of folding/unfolding for they represent momentary excursions of the protein to explore conformations in the neighborhood of the stable conformation. The present study looks for precursory signatures of protein folding/unfolding within these rapid fluctuations through a combination of three techniques: (1) ultrafast shape recognition, (2) time series segmentation, and (3) time series correlation analysis. The first procedure measures the differences between statistical distance distributions of atoms in different conformations by calculating shape similarity indices from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. The second procedure is used to discover the times at which the protein makes transitions from one conformation to another. Finally, we employ the third technique to exploit spatial fingerprints of the stable conformations; this procedure is to map out the sequences of changes preceding the actual folding and unfolding events, since strongly correlated atoms in different conformations are different due to bond and steric constraints. The aforementioned high-frequency fluctuations are therefore characterized by distinct correlational and structural changes that are associated with rate-limiting precursors that translate into brief segments. Guided by these technical procedures, we choose a model system, a fragment of the protein transthyretin, for identifying in this system not only the precursory signatures of transitions associated with a helix and beta hairpin, but also the important role played by weaker correlations in such protein folding dynamics.

This reflects the experimental challenges associated with characterizing these multidimensional surfaces, even for small proteins. Here we focus on a 62-residue protein, gpW, that folds very rapidly into a native structure with an alpha/beta topology in which a-helices are at the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule with a central beta-hairpin positioned orthogonally to the helices. Using relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy to probe the conformational fluctuations in gpW at 1 degrees C, we found that the native state interconverts with a transiently formed, sparsely populated second state with a lifetime of 250 mu s, consistent with the global folding-unfolding rate under these conditions. In this low-populated state, the beta-hairpin is unfolded whereas the alpha-helices remain predominantly formed. Our results argue for a hierarchical stability of secondary structural elements and demonstrate the existence of a complex free energy landscape even in this small, fast-folding single-domain protein.","[Sanchez-Medina, Celia; Cerminara, Michele; Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Sekhar, Ashok; Vallurupalli, Pramodh; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Sekhar, Ashok; Vallurupalli, Pramodh; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Sekhar, Ashok; Vallurupalli, Pramodh; Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Mol Struct & Funct, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada","Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Darwin 3,Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain.",vmunoz@cnb.csic.es; kay@pound.med.utoronto.ca,,"Sekhar, Ashok/0000-0002-8628-7799","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [BES-2009-029117, CSD2009-00088, BIO2011-28092]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); CIHRCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada;  [ERC-2012-ADG-323059]",C.S.-M. acknowledges support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness in the form of a predoctoral fellowship (BES-2009-029117).

Accordingly, the protein electrostatic field exerts a torque on the induced dipole, locally impeding the nucleation of ice at the protein-water interface. We evaluate the solvent orientation steering (SOS) as the reversible work needed to align the induced dipoles with the Debye electrostatic field and computed the SOS for the variable interface of a folding protein. The minimization of the SOS is shown to drive protein folding as evidenced by the entrainment of the total free energy by the SOS energy along trajectories that approach a Debye limit state where no torque arises. This result suggests that the minimization of anomalous water polarization at the interface promotes the sealing of packing defects, thereby maintaining structural integrity and committing the protein chain to fold.","[Fernandez, Ariel] CNR, CONICET, Inst Argentino Matemat, RA-1083 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fernandez, Ariel] Coll Basilea, Inst Adv Study, CH-4053 Basel, Switzerland","Fernandez, A (corresponding author), CNR, CONICET, Inst Argentino Matemat, Saavedra 15, RA-1083 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ariel@afinnovation.com,"Fernandez, Ariel/I-7925-2016","Fernandez, Ariel/0000-0002-5102-4294","Ariel Fernandez Consultancy, GmbH","The author is a senior investigator at the National Research Council of Argentina (CONICET) and was supported in part through Ariel Fernandez Consultancy, GmbH.",,20,7,7,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0953-8984,1361-648X,,J PHYS-CONDENS MAT,J.

Yet, its accurate determination based on computational techniques remains a challenge in physical chemistry. A straightforward brute-force approach would be to conduct molecular dynamics simulations and to estimate the folding free energy from the equilibrium population ratio of the unfolded and folded states. However, this approach is not sensible at physiological conditions where the equilibrium population ratio is vanishingly small: it is extremely difficult to reliably obtain such a small equilibrium population ratio due to the low rate of folding/unfolding transitions. It is therefore desirable to have a computational method that solely relies on simulations independently carried out for the folded and unfolded states. Here, we present such an approach that focuses on the probability distributions of the effective energy (solvent-averaged protein potential energy) in the folded and unfolded states. We construct these probability distributions for the protein villin headpiece subdomain by performing extensive molecular dynamics simulations and carrying out solvation free energy calculations. We find that the probability distributions of the effective energy are well-described by the Gaussian distributions for both the folded and unfolded states due to the central limit theorem, which enables us to calculate the protein folding free energy in terms of the mean and the width of the distributions. The computed protein folding free energy (-2.5 kcal/mol) is in accord with the experimental result (ranging from -2.3 to -3.2 kcal/mol depending on the experimental methods).","[Chong, Song-Ho; Ham, Sihyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul 140742, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 140742, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2012-0007855, 2012-0003068, 2012R1A2A01004687]; KISTI supercomputing center","This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Grant Nos. 2012-0007855, 2012-0003068, and 2012R1A2A01004687).

This has traditionally been a contentious issue particularly mask the complexity of the underlying folding landscape. Recent hydrogen-exchange experiments combined with mass spectrometry (HX-MS) reveal that the folding of RNase H proceeds in a hierarchical fashion with distinct intermediates and following a single discrete path. In our current work, we provide computational evidence for this unique folding mechanism by employing a structure-based statistical mechanical model. Upon calibrating the energetic terms of the model with equilibrium measurements, we predict multiple intermediate states in the folding of RNase H that closely resemble experimental observations. Remarkably, a simplified landscape representation adequately captures the folding complexity and predicts the possibility of a well-defined sequence of folding events. We supplement the statistical model study with both explicit solvent molecular simulations of the helical units and electrostatic calculations to provide structural and energetic insights into the early and late stages of RNase H folding that hint at the frustrated nature of its folding landscape.","[Narayan, Abhishek; Naganathan, Athi N.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India","Naganathan, AN (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",athi@iitm.ac.in,"Narayan, Abhishek/T-9152-2019","Narayan, Abhishek/0000-0001-5390-2380; Naganathan, Athi N/0000-0002-1655-7802","Department of Biotechnology, New Delhi, IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) India","We thank Jose Manuel Sanchez-Ruiz for help with the TK algorithm.

The method is applied to the complex alpha-helix <->beta-sheet transition in a beta-hairpin miniprotein in implicit solvent, which exhibits much of the complexity of conformational changes in proteins. Two transition paths are considered, one derived from a linear interpolant between the endpoint structures and the other derived from a targeted dynamics simulation. Two methods for computing the conformational free energy (FE) along the string are compared, a restrained method, and a tessellation method introduced by E. Vanden-Eijnden and M. Venturoli [J. Chem. Phys. 130, 194103 (2009)]. It is found that obtaining meaningful free energy profiles using the present atom-based coordinates requires restricting sampling to a vicinity of the converged path, where the hyperplanar approximation to the isocommittor surface is sufficiently accurate. This sampling restriction can be easily achieved using restraints or constraints. The endpoint FE differences computed from the FE profiles are validated by comparison with previous calculations using a path-independent confinement method. The FE profiles are decomposed into the enthalpic and entropic contributions, and it is shown that the entropy difference contribution can be as large as 10 kcal/mol for intermediate regions along the path, compared to 15-20 kcal/mol for the enthalpy contribution. This result demonstrates that enthalpic barriers for transitions are offset by entropic contributions arising from the existence of different paths across a barrier. The possibility of using systematically coarse-grained representations of amino acids, in the spirit of multiple interaction site residue models, is proposed as a means to avoid ad hoc sampling restrictions to narrow transition tubes.

As a compromise, an intermediate-resolution lattice model has been constructed in the present work. Each residue is decomposed into four basic units, i.e. the alpha-carbon group, the carboxyl group, the imino group, and the side-chain group, and each basic coarse-grained unit is represented by a minimum cubic box with eight lattice sites. The spacing of the lattice is about 0.56 angstrom, holding the highest spatial resolution for the present lattice protein models. As the first report of this new model, the helix-coil transition of a polyalanine chain was examined via dynamic Monte Carlo simulation. The period of formed alpha-helix was about 3.68 residues, close to that of a natural alpha-helix. The resultant backbone motion was found to be in the realistic regions of the conformational space in the Ramachandran plot. Helix propagation constant and nucleation constant were further determined through the dynamic hydrogen bonding process and torsional angle variation, and the results were used to make comparison between classical Zimm-Bragg theory and Lifson-Roig theory based on the Qian-Schellman relationship. The simulation results confirmed that our lattice model can reproduce the helix-coil transition of polypeptide and construct a moderately fine alpha-helix conformation without significantly weakening the priority in efficiency for a lattice model.","[Chen, Yantao] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Funct Polymer, State Key Lab Mol Engn Polymers, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jiandong] Fudan Univ, State Key Lab Mol Engn Polymers, Adv Mat Lab, Dept Macromol Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China","Chen, YT (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Funct Polymer, State Key Lab Mol Engn Polymers, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",ytchen@szu.edu.cn; jdding1@fudan.edu.cn,,"chen, yantao/0000-0001-8686-1116","NSF of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21034002, 21174088]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (973 program)Ministry of Science and Technology, ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2009CB930000]; Basic Research Program of Shenzhen Municipal Scientific and Technological R D funding [JC201105130434A]; Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Molecular Engineering of Polymers [K2012-03]","The authors are grateful for the financial support from NSF of China (Nos. 21034002, 21174088), Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (973 program No. 2009CB930000), the Basic Research Program of Shenzhen Municipal Scientific and Technological R & D funding (No. JC201105130434A), Opening Project of State Key Laboratory of Molecular Engineering of Polymers (No. K2012-03), for the computing resources provided by the High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) of Nanjing University and the National Supercomputing Centre in Shenzhen of China.",,65,1,1,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0739-1102,1538-0254,,J BIOMOL STRUCT DYN,J.

This coupled study of fast-folding proteins has provided insight into the mechanisms, which allow some proteins to find their native conformation well <1ms and has uncovered examples of theoretically predicted phenomena such as downhill folding. The study of fast folders also informs our understanding of even slow' folding processes: fast folders are small; relatively simple protein domains and the principles that govern their folding also govern the folding of more complex systems. This review summarizes the major theoretical and experimental techniques used to study fast-folding proteins and provides an overview of the major findings of fast-folding research. Finally, we examine the themes that have emerged from studying fast folders and briefly summarize their application to protein folding in general, as well as some work that is left to do.","[Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Gruebele, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 600 S Mathews Ave,RAL 29A, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mgruebel@illinois.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R02 GM 093318-4]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1019958]; James R.

Compared to long trajectories this method offers the possibility to start the simulations in successive batches, building a knowledgeable model of the available data to inform subsequent new simulations iteratively. Here, we demonstrate an automatic, iterative, on-the-fly method for learning and sampling molecular simulations in the context of ligand binding for the case of trypsin-benzamidine binding. The method uses Markov state models to learn a simplified model of the simulations and decide where best to sample from, achieving a converged binding affinity in approximately one microsecond, I order of magnitude faster than classical sampling.

They are biologically important, with approximately 20% of all eukaryotic proteins disordered, and found at the heart of many biochemical networks. To fulfil their biological roles, many IDPs need to bind to proteins and/or nucleic acids. And although unstructured in solution, IDPs typically fold into a well-defined three-dimensional structure upon interaction with a binding partner. The flexibility and structural diversity inherent to IDPs makes this coupled folding and binding difficult to study at atomic resolution by experiment alone, and computer simulation currently offers perhaps the best opportunity to understand this process. But simulation of coupled folding and binding is itself extremely challenging; these molecules are large and highly flexible, and their binding partners, such as DNA or cyclins, are also often large. Therefore, their study requires either simplified representations, advanced enhanced sampling schemes, or both. It is not always clear that existing simulation techniques, optimized for studying folded proteins, are well suited to IDPs. In this article, we examine the progress that has been made in the study of coupled folding and binding using molecular dynamics simulation. We summarize what has been learnt, and examine the state of the art in terms of both methodologies and models. We also consider the lessons to be learnt from advances in other areas of simulation and highlight the issues that remain of be addressed.","[Baker, Christopher M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543","FEBS Return to Europe Fellowship; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH)","C.M.B. is supported by a FEBS Return to Europe Fellowship.

Isotopically edited infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as a promising method for studying protein structural changes with site-specific resolution, but its full potential to systematically probe folding at multiple protein sites has not yet been realized. We have used C-13 isotopically edited IR spectroscopy to investigate the site-specific thermal unfolding at seven different locations in the de novo designed helix-turn-helix protein alpha t alpha. As one of the few stable helix-turn-helix motifs, alpha t alpha is an excellent model for studying the roles of secondary and tertiary interactions in folding. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments on the full alpha t alpha motif and its two peptide fragments show that interhelical tertiary contacts are critical for stabilization of the secondary structure. The site-specific thermal unfolding probed by C-13 isotopically edited IR is likewise consistent with primarily tertiary stabilization of the local structure. The least thermally stable part of the alpha t alpha motif is near the turn where the interhelical contacts are rather loose, while the motifs center with best established core packing has the highest stability. Similar correlation between the local thermal stability and tertiary contacts was found previously for a naturally occurring helix-turn-helix motif. These results underline the importance of native-like tertiary stabilizing interactions in folding, in agreement with recent state-of-the art folding simulations as well as simplified, native-centric models.","[Kubelka, Ginka S.; Kubelka, Jan] Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Kubelka, J (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jkubelka@uwyo.edu,,,National Science Foundation CAREER grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0846140],We thank Milan Balaz for the use of CD and HPLC instruments and Benjamin Anderson for proofreading of the manuscript.

However, since conventional site-directed mutagenesis cannot be applied to perturb the backbone, the contribution of these hydrogen bonds in protein folding and stability has been assessed only for a very limited set of small proteins. We have here investigated effects of five amide-to-ester mutations in the backbone of a PDZ domain, a 90-residue globular protein domain, to probe the influence of hydrogen bonds in a b-sheet for folding and stability. The amide-to-ester mutation removes NH-mediated hydrogen bonds and destabilizes hydrogen bonds formed by the carbonyl oxygen. The overall stability of the PDZ domain generally decreased for all amide-to-ester mutants due to an increase in the unfolding rate constant. For this particular region of the PDZ domain, it is therefore clear that native hydrogen bonds are formed after crossing of the rate-limiting barrier for folding. Moreover, three of the five amide-to-ester mutants displayed an increase in the folding rate constant suggesting that the hydrogen bonds are involved in non-native interactions in the transition state for folding.","[Pedersen, Soren W.; Hultqvist, Greta; Jemth, Per] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, Biomed Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Pedersen, Soren W.; Stromgaard, Kristian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Drug Design & Pharmacol, Copenhagen, Denmark","Stromgaard, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Drug Design & Pharmacol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",kristian.stromgaard@sund.ku.dk; Per.Jemth@imbim.uu.se,,"Hultqvist, Greta/0000-0002-4136-6792; Stromgaard, Kristian/0000-0003-2206-4737",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2012-5096]; Danish Council for Independent Research Medical SciencesDet Frie Forskningsrad (DFF); Lundbeck FoundationLundbeckfonden,"This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant 2012-5096, PJ)(http://www.vr.se/inenglish.4.12fff4451215cbd83e4800015152.html), the Danish Council for Independent Research Medical Sciences (KS)(http://fivu.dk/en/research-and-innovation/funding-programmes-for-research-and-innovation/find-danish-funding-programmes/dff-the-danish-council-for-independent-research), and the Lundbeck Foundation (KS).

However, the accuracy of molecular simulations on general-purpose computers depends on the time scale of the events of interest. Advanced simulation methods, such as accelerated molecular dynamics, have shown tremendous promise in sampling the conformational dynamics of biomolecules, where standard molecular dynamics simulations are nonergodic. Here we present a sampling method based on accelerated molecular dynamics in which rotatable dihedral angles and nonbonded interactions are boosted separately. This method (RaMD-db) is a different implementation of the dual-boost accelerated molecular dynamics, introduced earlier. The advantage is that this method speeds up sampling of the conformational space of biomolecules in explicit solvent, as the degrees of freedom most relevant for conformational transitions are accelerated. We tested RaMD-db on one of the most difficult sampling problems - protein folding. Starting from fully extended polypeptide chains, two fast folding alpha-helical proteins (Trpcage and the double mutant of C-terminal fragment of Villin headpiece) and a designed beta-hairpin (Chignolin) were completely folded to their native structures in very short simulation time. Multiple folding/unfolding transitions could be observed in a single trajectory. Our results show that RaMD-db is a promisingly fast and efficient sampling method for conformational transitions in explicit solvent. RaiMD-db thus opens new avenues for understanding biomolecular self-assembly and functional dynamics occurring on long time and length scales.","[Hamelberg, Donald] Georgia State Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; Georgia State Univ, Ctr Biotechnol & Drug Design, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA","Hamelberg, D (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Chem, POB 3965, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",dhamelberg@gsu.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0953061]; Georgia Research Alliance; Georgia State's IBM System p7 supercomputer through a partnership of the Southeastern Universities Research Association,"This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation (MCB-0953061) and the Georgia Research Alliance.

Starting from the extended conformation, the secondary structure of all three helices in HP-36 was formed in about 50 ns and remained stable in the remaining simulation. However, the formation of the tertiary structure was difficult. Although some intermediates were close to the native structure, the overall conformation was not stable. Further analysis revealed that the large structure fluctuation of loop and hydrophobic core regions was devoted mostly to the instability of the structure during MD simulation. The backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the loop and hydrophobic core regions showed strong correlation with the backbone RMSD of the whole protein. The free energy landscape indicated that the distribution of main chain torsions in loop and turn regions was far away from the native state. Starting from an intermediate structure extracted from the initial AMBER simulation, HP-36 was found to generally fold to the native state under the dynamically adjusted polarized protein-specific charge (DPPC) simulation, while the peptide did not fold into the native structure when AMBER force filed was used. The two best folded structures were extracted and taken into further simulations in water employing AMBER03 charge and DPPC for 25 ns. Result showed that introducing polarization effect into interacting potential could stabilize the near-native protein structure.","[Duan, Li L.; Zhang, Qing G.] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Duan, Li L.; Tang, Bo] Shandong Normal Univ, Key Lab Mol & Nano Probes, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Functionalized Probes Chem, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci,Minist Educ, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tong; Zhang, John Z.

Dimerization and enzymatic activity of RNase L is stimulated by 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates (pA(25)A(25)A; 2-5A). First, it was necessary to ensure that a complex of monomeric human RNase L and 25A was stable in MD simulations. It turned out that Glu131 had to be protonated. The non-protonated Glu131 caused dissociation of 2-5A from RNase L. Because of the atypical 2'-5' internucleotide linkages and a specific spatial arrangement of the 25A trimer, when a single molecule carries all possible conformers of the glycosidic torsion angle, several versions of the AMBER force field were tested. One that best maintained functionally important interactions of 25A and RNase L was selected for subsequent MD simulations. Furthermore, we wonder whether powerful GPUs are able to produce MD trajectories long enough to convincingly demonstrate effects of subtle perturbations of interactions between 25A and RNase L. Detrimental impacts of various point mutations of RNase L (R155A, F126A, W60A, K89A) on 2-5A binding were observed on a time scale of 200 ns. Finally, 2-5A analogues with a bridged 3'-O,4'-C-alkylene linkage (B) introduced into the adenosine units (A) were used to assess ability of MD simulations to distinguish on the time scale of hundreds of nanoseconds between agonists of RNase L (pA(25)A(25)B, pB(25)A(25)A, pB(25)A(25)B) and inactive analogs (pA(25)B(25)A, pA(25)B(25)B, pB(25)B(25)A, pB(25)B(25)B).

For a detailed understanding of a protein's function, its entire structural landscape at atomic resolution and insight into the interconversion between all the structural states (i.e. dynamics) are required. Whereas dedicated trickery with NMR relaxation provides aspects of local dynamics, and 3D structure determination by NMR is well established, only recently have several attempts been made to formulate a more comprehensive description of the dynamics and the structural landscape of a protein. Here, a perspective is given on the use of exact NOEs (eNOEs) for the elucidation of structural ensembles of a protein describing the covered conformational space. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This strategy is demonstrated for two case studies; the design of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases with improved regioselectivity and of thiamine diphosphate dependent enzymes with improved stereoselectivity. In both families, two selectivity hotspots are found in almost all sequences, and simple, generic rules are established to predict the effect of mutations at these positions on selectivity. The crucial role of the hotspot positions is validated for an increasing number of enzymes by designing variants with improved or switched selectivity.","Univ Stuttgart, Inst Tech Biochem, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Pleiss, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Tech Biochem, Allmandring 31, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",Juergen.Pleiss@itb.uni-stuttgart.de,,,"Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR1296, SFB706, SFB716]","Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (FOR1296, SFB706, and SFB716) is gratefully acknowledged.",,39,13,13,0,23,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",1867-3880,1867-3899,,CHEMCATCHEM,ChemCatChem,APR,2014,6,4,,,SI,,944,950,,10.1002/cctc.201300950,,,7,"Chemistry, Physical",Chemistry,AE7LW,WOS:000334180500005,,,,,2020-11-19,

MSMs can predict both stationary and kinetic quantities on long timescales (e.g. milliseconds) using a set of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are individually much shorter, thus addressing the well-known sampling problem in molecular dynamics simulation. In addition to providing predictive quantitative models, MSMs greatly facilitate both the extraction of insight into biomolecular mechanism (such as folding and functional dynamics) and quantitative comparison with single-molecule and ensemble kinetics experiments. A variety of methodological advances and software paokages now bring the construction of these models closer to routine practice. Here, we review recent progress in this field, considering theoretical and methodological advances, new software tools, and recent applications of these approaches in several domains of biochemistry and biophysics, commenting on remaining challenges.","[Chodera, John D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Sloan Kettering Inst, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Noe, Frank] Free Univ

As a result, long MD trajectories tend to drift away from the starting coordinates (e.g., crystallographic structures). To address this problem, we have devised a new simulation strategy aimed at protein crystals. An MD simulation of protein crystal is essentially an ensemble simulation involving multiple protein molecules in a crystal unit cell (or a block of unit cells). To ensure that average protein coordinates remain correct during the simulation, we introduced crystallography-based restraints into the MD protocol. Because these restraints are aimed at the ensemble-average structure, they have only minimal impact on conformational dynamics of the individual protein molecules. So long as the average structure remains reasonable, the proteins move in a native-like fashion as dictated by the original force field. To validate this approach, we have used the data from solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which is the orthogonal experimental technique uniquely sensitive to protein local dynamics. The new method has been tested on the well-established model protein, ubiquitin. The ensemble-restrained MD simulations produced lower crystallographic R factors than conventional simulations; they also led to more accurate predictions for crystallographic temperature factors, solid-state chemical shifts, and backbone order parameters. The predictions for N-15 R1 relaxation rates are at least as accurate as those obtained from conventional simulations. Taken together, these results suggest that the presented trajectories may be among the most realistic protein MD simulations ever reported. In this context, the ensemble restraints based on high-resolution crystallographic data can be viewed as protein-specific empirical corrections to the standard force fields.","[Xue, Yi; Skrynnikov, Nikolai R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Skrynnikov, Nikolai R.] St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Biomol NMR, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","Skrynnikov, NR (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, 560 Oval Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nikolai@purdue.edu,,,NSF grantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1158347]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1158347] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Grant sponsor: NSF grant; Grant number: MCB 1158347.,,99,15,15,2,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,APR,2014,23,4,,,,,488,507,,10.1002/pro.2433,,,20,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,AD3MM,WOS:000333143800015,24452989,Green Published,,,2020-11-19,

This includes the stationary distribution, the metastable states, and state-to-state transition rates. Here, we present a variational approach for computing these dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This approach is analogous to the variational approach used for computing stationary states in quantum mechanics. A corresponding method of linear variation is formulated. It is shown that the matrices needed for the linear variation method are correlation matrices that can be estimated from simple MD simulations for a given basis set. The method proposed here is thus to first define a basis set able to capture the relevant conformational transitions, then compute the respective correlation matrices, and then to compute their dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors, thus obtaining the key ingredients of the slow. kinetics.","[Nueske, Feliks; Keller, Bettina G.; Perez-Hernandez, Guillermo; Mey, Antonia S.

Atomic-level detail regarding dynamical changes that facilitate protein aggregation, as well as the structural features of large-scale ordered aggregates and soluble non-native oligomers, would contribute significantly to current understanding of these complex phenomena and offer potential strategies for inhibiting formation of cytotoxic species. However, experimental limitations often preclude the acquisition of high-resolution structural and mechanistic information for aggregating systems. Computational methods, particularly those combine both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations to cover a wide range of time and length scales, have thus emerged as crucial tools for investigating protein aggregation. Here we review the current state of computational methodology for the study of protein self-assembly, with a focus on the application of these methods toward understanding of protein aggregates in human neurodegenerative disorders.","[Redler, Rachel L.; Shirvanyants, David; Dagliyan, Onur; Ding, Feng; Kim, Doo Nam; Kota, Pradeep; Proctor, Elizabeth A.; Ramachandran, Srinivas; Tandon, Arpit; Dokholyan, Nikolay V.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Dagliyan, Onur; Kim, Doo Nam; Kota, Pradeep; Proctor, Elizabeth A.; Ramachandran, Srinivas; Tandon, Arpit; Dokholyan, Nikolay V.] Univ N Carolina, Program Cellular & Mol Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Proctor, Elizabeth A.; Dokholyan, Nikolay V.] Univ N Carolina, Curriculum Bioinformat & Computat Biol, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Dokholyan, Nikolay V.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Computat & Syst Biol, Chapel Hill, NC USA","Dokholyan, NV (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",dokh@unc.edu,"Ding, Feng/G-6029-2011; Dagliyan, Onur/N-5683-2019; Dokholyan, Nikolay/D-8081-2018; Proctor, Elizabeth A./K-2350-2012","Ding, Feng/0000-0003-1850-6336; Dagliyan, Onur/0000-0003-1825-1011; Dokholyan, Nikolay/0000-0002-8225-4025; Kim, Doo Nam/0000-0001-9895-7190; Ramachandran, Srinivas/0000-0003-2929-1377; Proctor, Elizabeth A./0000-0002-7627-2198","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM080742, F31NS073435, F31AG039266]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742, R01GM080742] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [F31NS073435, F31NS073435, F31NS073435] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [F31AG039266, F31AG039266, F31AG039266] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Awards R01GM080742 (to N.V.D.), F31NS073435 (to R.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein folding present a formidable challenge since these conformational changes occur on a time scale much longer than what can be afforded at the current level of computational technology. Transition state (TS) theory offers a more economic description of kinetic properties of a reaction system by relating them to the properties of the TS, or for flexible systems, the TS ensemble ( TSE). The application of TS theory to protein folding is limited by ambiguity in the definition of the TSE for this process. We propose to identify the TSE for conformational changes in flexible systems by comparison of its experimentally determined volumetric property, known as the volume of activation, to the structure-specific volume profile of the process calculated using MD. We illustrate this approach by its successful application to unfolding of a model chain system.

Thus, pressure-jump (P-jump)-induced protein refolding, if it could be made fast enough, would be ideally suited for comparison with MD. Although pressure denaturation perturbs secondary structure less than temperature denaturation, protein refolding after a fast P-jump is not necessarily faster than that after a temperature jump. Recent P-jump refolding experiments on the helix bundle lambda-repressor have shown evidence of a <3 mu s burst phase, but also of a similar to 1.5 ms slow phase of refolding, attributed to non-native helical structure frustrating microsecond refolding. Here we show that a lambda-repressor mutant is nonetheless capable of refolding in a single explicit solvent MD trajectory in about 19 mu s, indicating that the burst phase observed in experiments on the same mutant could produce native protein. The simulation reveals that after about 18.5 mu s of conformational sampling, the productive structural rearrangement to the native state does not occur in a single swift step but is spread out over a brief series of helix and loop rearrangements that take about 0.9 mu s. Our results support the molecular time scale inferred for lambda-repressor from near-downhill folding experiments, where transition-state population can be seen experimentally, and also agrees with the transition-state transit time observed in slower folding proteins by single-molecule spectroscopy.","[Liu, Yanxin; Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Prigozhin, Maxim B.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Schulten, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kschulte@ks.illinois.edu; mgruebel@illinois.edu,"Liu, Yanxin/D-8633-2011","Liu, Yanxin/0000-0002-2253-3698","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [9P41GM104601, R01 GM093318-04]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY0822613]; Texas Advanced Computing Center via Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) grant [MCA93S028]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, National Institutes of Health [RC2GM093307]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, RC2GM093307, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, RC2GM093307, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grants 9P41GM104601 (computation) and R01 GM093318-04 (experiments) from the National Institutes of Health and PHY0822613 from the National Science Foundation.

The results provide evidence for a compact well-structured folded state and a heterogeneous fast-exchanging denatured state ensemble exhibiting residual secondary structure. The folding rate of 26.4 mu(s-1) (at 80 degrees C), extracted from the T-jump response of NTL9(1-39), compares favorably with the 18 mu(s-1) obtained from the MSM. Structural decomposition of the MSM and analysis along the folding coordinate indicates that helix-formation nucleates the global folding. Simulated difference spectra, corresponding to the global folding transition of the MSM, are in qualitative agreement with measured T-jump 2D IR spectra. The experiments demonstrate the use of T-jump 2D IR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for studying protein folding, with direct connections to simulations. The results suggest that in addition to predicting the correct native structure and folding time constant, molecular dynamics simulations carried out with modern force fields provide an accurate description of folding mechanisms in small proteins.","[Lin, Yu-Shan; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beauchamp, Kyle A.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Baiz, Carlos R.; Peng, Chunte Sam; Tokmakoff, Andrei] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Voelz, Vincent A.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Tokmakoff, A (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tokmakoff@uchicago.edu,"Lin, Yu-Shan/E-2198-2013","Lin, Yu-Shan/0000-0001-6460-2877; Voelz, Vincent/0000-0002-1054-2124","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHB-0911107]; MIT Laser Biomedical Research Center [P41-EB015871]; Agilent Technologies; National Eye InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI) [PN2EY016525]; Ruth L.

Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computational model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian energy landscape tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian hyperensembles over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and (3)J measurements gives convergent values of the peptide's alpha, beta, and PPII, conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accurate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELT's principled framework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data.","[Beauchamp, Kyle A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat Biol Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.; Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Das, Rhiju] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu; rhiju@stanford.edu,,"Das, Rhiju/0000-0001-7497-0972","Stanford Graduate FellowshipStanford University; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 GM062868, U54 GM072970, 2P01 GM066275]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0954714]; Burroughs Wellcome Foundation (CASI); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54GM072970, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, R01GM062868, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, U54GM072970, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275, P01GM066275] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank John Chodera, T.

However, the so far developed [2.2]paracyclophane-bridged imidazole dimers, which are one of the best candidates for fast photochromic molecules, have their weaknesses for these requirements. Herein, we overcome the issues with sustaining fast photochromism and high durability by flipping the two imidazole rings (the head-to-tail and tail-to-tail forms). The alteration in the relative configuration of the imidazole rings suppresses the broad absorption band resulting from the radical-radical interaction. The substitution to the 2-position of the imidazole ring of the tail-to-tail form gives the drastic changes in the steady-state and the transient absorption spectra. The pyrene-substituted tail-to-tail form demonstrates that the transient absorption spectrum is featured by the inherent spectrum of the imidazolyl radical. This molecular framework is easy to functionalize fast photochromic molecules such as sensitizations to the red light, chirality, and biological tagging, and therefore it is versatile for various fast photochromic applications.","[Shima, Kentaro; Mutoh, Katsuya; Kobayashi, Yoichi; Abe, Jiro] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, Chuo Ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan; [Abe, Jiro] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, CREST, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1020076, Japan","Abe, J (corresponding author), Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Chem, Chuo Ku, 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2525258, Japan.",jiro_abe@chem.aoyama.ac.jp,"Mutoh, Katsuya/R-3059-2018; Kobayashi, Yoichi/A-2343-2010; Abe, Jiro/B-2045-2010","Mutoh, Katsuya/0000-0002-9778-8329; Kobayashi, Yoichi/0000-0003-3339-3755; Abe, Jiro/0000-0002-0237-815X","Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [22245025]; JSPS for Young ScientistsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22245025, 12J09290] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported partly by the Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (22245025) from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

Understanding these differences is crucial because such configurations serve as starting points of folding studies, and thus can affect both the folding mechanism and the kinetics. Here we provide a detailed comparison of both chemically induced and force-induced unfolded state ensembles of ubiquitin based on extensive, all-atom simulations of the protein either extended by force or denatured by urea. As expected, the respective unfolded states are very different on a macromolecular scale, being fully extended under force with no contacts and partially extended in urea with many nonnative contacts. The amount of residual secondary structure also differs: A significant population of a-helices is found in chemically denatured configurations but such helices are absent under force, except at the lowest applied force of 30 pN where short helices form transiently. We see that typical-size helices are unstable above this force, and beta-sheets cannot form. More surprisingly, we observe striking differences in the backbone dihedral angle distributions for the protein unfolded under force and the one unfolded by denaturant. A simple model based on the dialanine peptide is shown to not only provide an explanation for these striking differences but also illustrates how the force dependence of the protein dihedral angle distributions give rise to the worm-like chain behavior of the chain upon force.","[Stirnemann, Guillaume; Berne, Bruce J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kang, Seung-gu; Zhou, Ruhong] IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, Computat Biol Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USA","Berne, BJ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ruhongz@us.ibm.com; bb8@columbia.edu,"Stirnemann, Guillaume/G-8485-2011","Stirnemann, Guillaume/0000-0002-5631-5699; Zhou, Ruhong/0000-0001-8624-5591","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH-GM4330]; National Science Foundation through TeraGrid resourcesNational Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Supercomputing Applications [MCA08X002]; IBM Blue Gene Science Program; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340, R01GM043340] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH-GM4330 to B.

Computational biophysicists can take advantage of both PLUMED's rich syntax to define collective variables (CVs) and VMD's chemically-aware atom selection language, while working within a natural point-and-click interface: Pre-defined templates and syntax mnemonics facilitate the definition of well-known reaction coordinates. Complex CVs, e.g. involving reference snapshots used for RMSD or native contacts calculations, can be built through dialogs that provide a synoptic view of the available options. Scripts can be either exported for use in simulation programs, or evaluated on the currently loaded molecular trajectories. Script development takes place without leaving VMD, thus enabling an incremental try-see-modify development model for molecular metrics.

A quantum theory on protein folding is proposed. Compared with other dynamical variables such as mobile electrons, chemical bonds and stretching-bending vibrations the molecular torsion has the lowest energy and can be looked as the slow variable of the system. Simultaneously, from the multi-minima property of torsion potential the local conformational states are well defined. Following the idea that the slow variables slave the fast ones and using the nonadiabaticity operator method we deduce the Hamiltonian describing conformational change. It is shown that the influence of fast variables on the macromolecule can fully be taken into account through a phase transformation of slow variable wave function. Starting from the conformation-transition Hamiltonian the nonradiative matrix element was calculated and a general formulas for protein folding rate was deduced. The analytical form of the formula was utilized to study the temperature dependence of protein folding rate and the curious non-Arrhenius temperature relation was interpreted. By using temperature dependence data the multi-torsion correlation was studied. The decoherence time of quantum torsion state is estimated. The proposed folding rate formula gives a unifying approach for the study of a large class problems of biological conformational change.","Inner Mongolia Univ, Fac Phys Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China","Luo, LF (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ, Fac Phys Sci & Technol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China.",lolfcm@mail.imu.edu.cn,,,,,,29,5,7,0,11,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-7348,1869-1927,,SCI CHINA PHYS MECH,Sci.

The function of MHC I molecules is to select high affinity peptides from a large intracellular pool and they are assisted in this process by co-factor molecules, notably tapasin. In contrast to mammals, MHC homozygous chickens express a single MHC I gene locus, termed BF2, which is hypothesised to have co-evolved with the highly polymorphic tapasin within stable haplotypes. The BF2 molecules of the B15 and B19 haplotypes have recently been shown to differ in their interactions with tapasin and in their peptide selection properties. This study investigated whether these observations might be explained by differences in the protein plasticity that is encoded into the MHC I structure by primary sequence polymorphisms. Furthermore, we aimed to demonstrate the utility of a complimentary modelling approach to the understanding of complex experimental data. Combining mechanistic molecular dynamics simulations and the primary sequence based technique of statistical coupling analysis, we show how two of the eight polymorphisms between BF2*15:01 and BF2*19:01 facilitate differences in plasticity. We show that BF2*15: 01 is intrinsically more plastic than BF2*19: 01, exploring more conformations in the absence of peptide. We identify a protein sector of contiguous residues connecting the membrane bound alpha(3) domain and the heavy chain peptide binding site. This sector contains two of the eight polymorphic residues. One is residue 22 in the peptide binding domain and the other 220 is in the alpha(3) domain, a putative tapasin binding site. These observations are in correspondence with the experimentally observed functional differences of these molecules and suggest a mechanism for how modulation of MHC I plasticity by tapasin catalyses peptide selection allosterically.","[Bailey, Alistair; van Hateren, Andy; Elliott, Tim; Werner, Joern M.] Univ Southampton, Inst Life Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Bailey, Alistair; van Hateren, Andy; Elliott, Tim] Univ Southampton, Fac Med, Canc Sci Unit, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; [Werner, Joern M.] Univ Southampton, Fac Nat & Environm Sci, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England","Elliott, T (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Inst Life Sci, Southampton, Hants, England.",T.J.Elliott@soton.ac.uk; J.M.Werner@soton.ac.uk,"Werner, Joern/E-1148-2013","van Hateren, Andy/0000-0002-3915-0239; Elliott, Tim/0000-0003-1097-0222; /0000-0003-0023-8679; Werner, Jorn/0000-0002-4712-1833",MRC/Microsoft Research UK; CRUKCancer Research UK [CRUK/A10601]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L010402/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"This work was supported by a MRC/Microsoft Research UK studentship and centenary award and CRUK (Programme number CRUK/A10601).

Yet, with aging, some L proteins assemble into harmful amyloid aggregates associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which presents a complex and costly challenge to our society. Thus, far, drug after drug has failed to slow the progression of AD, characterized by the self-assembly of the 39-43 amino add beta-amylold (A beta) protein into extracellular senile plaques that form a cross-beta structure. While there is experimental evidence that the A beta small oligomers are the primary toxic species, standard tools of biology have failed to provide structures of these transient, inhomogeneous assemblies. Despite extensive experimental studies, researchers have not successfully characterized the nucleus ensemble, the starting point for rapid fibril formation. Similarly scientists do not have atomic data to show how the compounds that reduce both fibril formation and toxicity in cells bind to A beta 42 oligomers. In this context, computer simulations are important tools for gaining insights into the self-assembly of amyloid peptides and the molecular mechanism of inhibitors. This Account reviews what analytical models and simulations at different time and length scales tell us about the dynamics, kinetics, and thermodynamics of amyloid fibril formation and, notably, the nucleation process. Though coarse-grained and mesoscopic protein models approximate atomistic details by averaging out unimportant degrees of freedom, they provide generic features of amyloid formation and insights into mechanistic details of the self-assembly process. The thermodynamics and kinetics vary from linear peptides adopting straight beta-strands in fibrils to longer peptides adopting in parallel U shaped conformations in fibrils. In addition, these properties change with the balance between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and the intrinsic disorder of the system. However, simulations suggest that the critical nucleus size might be on the order of 20 chains under physiological conditions. The transition state might be characterized by a simultaneous change from mixed antiparallel/parallel beta-strands with random side-chain packing to the final antiparallel or parallel states with the steric zipper packing of the side chains. Second, we review our current computer-based knowledge of the 3D structures of inhibitors with A beta 42 monomer and oligomers, a prerequisite for developing new drugs against AD. Recent extensive all-atom simulations of A beta 42 dimers with known inhibitors such as the green tea compound epigallocatechin-3-gallate and 1,4-naphthoquinon-2-yl-L-tryptophan provide a spectrum of initial A beta 42/inhibitor structures useful for screening and drug design. We conclude by discussing future directions that may offer opportunities to fully understand nucleation and further AD drug development.","[Nguyent, Phuong; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, Lab Biochim Theor,UPR 9080,IBPC, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CNRS, Lab Biochim Theor,UPR 9080,IBPC, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019",,ANR GRAL SIMIFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [12-BS07-0017]; Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation,This work was supported by grants from ANR GRAL SIMI 12-BS07-0017 and Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation.,,60,82,84,3,135,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0001-4842,1520-4898,,ACCOUNTS CHEM RES,Accounts Chem.

The hydrophobic core is arranged around a single central Trp residue. Despite several experimental and simulation studies the detailed folding mechanism of the Trp-cage protein is still not completely understood. Starting from fully extended as well as from partially folded Trp-cage structures a series of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent and using four different force fields was performed. All simulations resulted in rapid collapse of the protein to on average relatively compact states. The simulations indicate a significant dependence of the speed of folding to near-native states on the side chain rotamer state of the central Trp residue. Whereas the majority of intermediate start structures with the central Trp side chain in a near-native rotameric state folded successfully within less than 100 ns only a fraction of start structures reached near-native folded states with an initially non-native Trp side chain rotamer state. Weak restraining of the Trp side chain dihedral angles to the state in the folded protein resulted in significant acceleration of the folding both starting from fully extended or intermediate conformations. The results indicate that the side chain conformation of the central Trp residue can create a significant barrier for controlling transitions to a near native folded structure. Similar mechanisms might be of importance for the folding of other protein structures.,"[Kannan, Srinivasaraghavan] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioinformat Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Kannan, Srinivasaraghavan] Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Ctr Expt Therapeut, Singapore, Singapore; [Zacharias, Martin] Tech Univ Munich, Phys Dept T38, Garching, Germany","Kannan, S (corresponding author), Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Bioinformat Inst, Singapore, Singapore.",raghavk@bii.a-star.edu.sg; Martin.Zacharias@ph.tum.de,,,"DFG (Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich: CIPSM); European Union (PRACE-0 project) [pr89tu]; Joint Council Office (JCO) [11/03/FG/07/05]; Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), SingaporeAgency for Science Technology & Research (ASTAR)","We thank the DFG (Center of Integrated Protein Science Munich: CIPSM), European Union (PRACE-0 project pr89tu) and Joint Council Office (JCO) (11/03/FG/07/05), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, for financial support.

Major advances in understanding fundamental principles underlying protein folding in optimized in vitro conditions have yielded detailed physicochemical principles of folding landscapes for small, single domain proteins. In addition, there has been increased research focusing on the key features of protein folding in the cell that differentiate it from in vitro folding, such as co-translational folding, chaperone-facilitated folding, and folding in crowded conditions with many weak interactions. Yet these two research areas have not been bridged effectively in research carried out to date. This review points to gaps between the two that are ripe for future research. Moreover, we emphasize the biological selection pressures that impact protein folding in vivo and how fitness drives the evolution of protein sequences in ways that may place foldability in tension with other requirements on a given protein. We suggest that viewing the physicochemical process of protein folding through the lens of evolution will unveil new insights and pose novel challenges about in-cell folding landscapes.","[Hingorani, Karan S.; Gierasch, Lila M.] Univ Massachusetts, Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Hingorani, Karan S.; Gierasch, Lila M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Gierasch, Lila M.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Gierasch, LM (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Program Mol & Cellular Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gierasch@biochem.umass.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM027616, OD00945]; University of Massachusetts, Amherst, as a part of the Chemistry-Biology Interface Program; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32 GM08515]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM101644, R01GM101644, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM101644, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM101644, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515, R01GM027616, R01GM027616, T32GM008515] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DP1OD000945, DP1OD000945, DP1OD000945, DP1OD000945, DP1OD000945] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Work on in-cell protein folding and chaperone mechanisms in the laboratory of L.M.G. has been supported by National Institutes of Health grants GM027616 and OD00945.

Its unusual C-terminus plays multiple roles, as the amphiphilic helix acts as a membrane anchor, as a signal peptidase cleavage site, and as a retention/secretion signal. We analyzed the structure and membrane binding properties of this sequence to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. CD spectroscopy in different setups, as well as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the helical folding and showed that the helix is accommodated in the amphiphilic region of the lipid bilayer with a slight tilt rather than lying parallel to the surface. This model was confirmed by NMR analyses that also identified a central stretch of 15 residues within the helix that is fully shielded from the aqueous layer, which is C-terminally followed by a putative hairpin structure. These findings explain the strong membrane binding of the protein and provide clues to establishing the E-rns membrane contact, processing and secretion. Author Summary The E-rns protein (envelope protein, RNase, secreted) of pestiviruses represents one of the most fascinating proteins in virology. E-rns is not only an essential structural component of the virus particle but also an unspecific RNase. The latter activity is dispensable for pestivirus replication but represents a virulence factor involved in the establishment of lifelong persistent infection. These functions of E-rns are connected with its repressive activity on the type I interferon response of the infected host probably depending on secretion of part of the protein synthesized within the infected cell followed by its distribution with the blood stream. To understand the mechanisms leading to an equilibrium between intracellular retention (for production of virus particles) and secretion (for repression of the innate immune response) the principles of E-rns membrane binding need to be better understood. The recently published E-rns crystal structure, however, is lacking the relevant carboxyterminal membrane anchor region. We report here structure analyses of the E-rns membrane anchor bound to model membranes. This work was based on circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and structure simulations, and revealed a new type of membrane anchor for a surface protein. These data will help to explain the unusual functions of E-rns.","[Aberle, Daniel; Meyers, Gregor] Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Immunol, Greifswald, Germany; [Muhle-Goll, Claudia; Reisser, Sabine; Luy, Burkhard; Ulrich, Anne S.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Organ Chem, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Buerck, Jochen; Luy, Burkhard; Ulrich, Anne S.] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Biol Grenzflachen IBG 2, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Wolf, Moritz; Wenzel, Wolfgang] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Nanotechnol, D-76021 Karlsruhe, Germany","Aberle, D (corresponding author), Friedrich Loeffler Inst, Inst Immunol, Greifswald, Germany.",gregor.meyers@fli.bund.de,"Wenzel, Wolfgang/B-3207-2009; Luy, Burkhard/I-1918-2013; Ulrich, Anne S./H-5519-2013","Wenzel, Wolfgang/0000-0001-9487-4689; Luy, Burkhard/0000-0001-9580-6397; Reisser, Sabine/0000-0003-1224-6967; Ulrich, Anne S./0000-0001-5571-9483",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG-ME1367/4],"The work described in the manuscript was supported by grant DFG-ME1367/4 from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (URL:http://www.dfg.de/).

The intrinsic dynamic character of proteins has a strong influence on biomolecular recognition mechanisms and models such as conformational selection have been widely used to account for this dynamic association process. However, conformational changes occurring in the receptor prior and upon association with other molecules are diverse and not obvious to predict when only a few structures of the receptor are available. In view of the prominent role of protein flexibility in ligand binding and its implications for drug discovery, it is of great interest to identify receptor conformations that play a major role in biomolecular recognition before starting rational drug design efforts. In this review, we discuss a number of recent advances in computer-aided drug discovery techniques that have been proposed to incorporate receptor flexibility into structure-based drug design. The allowance for receptor flexibility provided by computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations or enhanced sampling techniques helps to improve the accuracy of methods used to estimate binding affinities and, thus, such methods can contribute to the discovery of novel drug leads.

While A2 V carriers remain healthy in the heterozygous state, they suffer from early onset AD in the homozygous state. As a first toward understanding the impact of A2 V on A beta at its earlier stage, we characterized the equilibrium ensemble of the A beta 1-28 wild type and A beta 1-28 A2 V monomers by means of extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. While global conformational properties such as the radius of gyration and the average secondary structure content of the whole peptides are very similar, the population of beta-hairpins is increased by a factor of 4 in A2 V, and this may explain the enhanced A beta 1-40 A2 V aggregation kinetics with respect to A beta 1-40 wild type. Both peptides display a non-negligible population of extended metastable conformations differing however in their atomic details that represent ideal seeds for polymerization. Remarkably, upon A2 V mutation, the intrinsic disorder of A beta 1-28 monomer is reduced by a factor of 2, and the free energy landscape is completely different. This difference in the conformational ensembles of the two peptides may explain in part why the mixture of the A beta 40 WT and A2 V peptides protects against AD.","[Nguyen, Phuong H.; Tarus, Bogdan; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Biochim Theor, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UPR CNRS 9080,IBPC, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] IUF, F-75005 Paris, France","Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Biochim Theor, Sorbonne Paris Cite, UPR CNRS 9080,IBPC, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019",,GRAL ANR SIMIFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [12-BS07-0017-01]; Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation,This work was supported by grants from the GRAL ANR SIMI 12-BS07-0017-01 and Pierre Gilles de Gennes Foundation.

To exploit the replica framework optimally, the level of the biasing potential in each replica was appropriately adapted during the simulations. This resulted in both high exchange rates between neighboring replicas and improved occupancy/flow of all conformers in each replica. The performance of the approach was tested on several peptide and protein systems and compared with regular MD simulations and previous REMD studies. Improved sampling of relevant conformational states was observed for unrestrained protein and peptide folding simulations as well as for refinement of a loop structure with restricted mobility of loop flanking protein regions.

The partial multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) was recently developed as a method that improved generalized ensemble (GE) methods to focus sampling only on a part of a system (GEPS); however, it was not tested well. We found that partial McMD did not work well for polylysine decapeptide and gave significantly worse sampling efficiency than a conventional GE. Herein, we elucidate the fundamental reason for this and propose a novel GEPS, adaptive lambda square dynamics (ALSD), which can resolve the problem faced when using partial McMD. We demonstrate that ALSD greatly increases the sampling efficiency over a conventional GE. We believe that ALSD is an effective method and is applicable to the conformational sampling of larger and more complicated biomolecule systems.

Nonetheless, experimental techniques do not yet allow for an arbitrary level of resolution on cellular processes in situ. By consistently integrating a variety of diverse experimental data, molecular modeling is optimally poised to enhance to near-atomistic resolution our understanding of molecular recognition in large assemblies. Within this integrative modeling context, we briefly review in this chapter the recent progresses of molecular simulations at the atomistic and coarse-grained level of resolution to explore protein protein interactions. In particular, we discuss our recent contributions in this field, which aim at providing a robust bridge between novel optimization algorithms and multiscale molecular simulations for a consistent integration of experimental inputs. We expect that, with the ever-growing sampling ability of molecular simulations and the tireless progress of experimental methods, the impact of such dynamic-based approach could only be more effective with time, contributing to provide detailed description of cellular organization.","[Spiga, Enrico; Degiacomi, Matteo Thomas; Dal Peraro, Matteo] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Lab Biomol Modeling, Inst Bioengn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Dal Peraro, Matteo] SIB, Lausanne, Switzerland","Dal Peraro, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Lab Biomol Modeling, Inst Bioengn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",matteo.dalperaro@epfl.ch,"Degiacomi, Matteo/M-4342-2017","Degiacomi, Matteo/0000-0003-4672-471X",,,,138,6,6,1,19,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1876-1623,,978-0-12-800013-7,ADV PROTEIN CHEM STR,Adv.

Although this technique provides unique information that cannot be obtained at the ensemble level, the possibility of studying fast molecular dynamics is limited by the number of photons detected per unit time ( photon count rate), which is proportional to the illumination intensity. However, simply increasing the illumination intensity often does not help because of various photophysical and photochemical problems. In this Perspective, we show how to improve the dynamic range of single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy at a given photon count rate by considering each and every photon and using a maximum likelihood method. For a photon trajectory with recorded photon colors and inter-photon times, the parameters of a model describing molecular dynamics are obtained by maximizing the appropriate likelihood function. We discuss various likelihood functions, their applicability, and the accuracy of the extracted parameters. The maximum likelihood method has been applied to analyze the experiments on fast two-state protein folding and to measure transition path times. Utilizing other information such as fluorescence lifetimes is discussed in the framework of two-dimensional FRET efficiency-lifetime histograms.","[Chung, Hoi Sung; Gopich, Irina V.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Chung, HS (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; irinag@niddk.nih.gov,"Chung, Hoi Sung/C-2624-2009","Chung, Hoi Sung/0000-0001-6897-4969","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)","We thank W.

We apply this algorithm to the folding of a small protein, Trp-Cage. Different kMC move sets that capture different possible rate limiting steps are implemented. The first uses secondary structure formation as a relevant rate event (a combination of dihedral rotations and hydrogen-bonding formation and breakage). The second uses tertiary structure formation events through formation of contacts via translational moves. Both methods fold the protein, but via different mechanisms and with different folding kinetics. The first method leads to folding via a structured helical state, with kinetics fit by a single exponential. The second method leads to folding via a collapsed loop, with kinetics poorly fit by single or double exponentials. In both cases, folding times are faster than experimentally reported values, The secondary and tertiary move sets are integrated in a third MD-kMC implementation, which now leads to folding of the protein via both pathways, with single and double-exponential fits to the rates, and to folding rates in good agreement with experimental values. The competition between secondary and tertiary structure leads to a longer search for the helix-rich intermediate in the case of the first pathway, and to the emergence of a kinetically trapped long-lived molten-globule collapsed state in the case of the second pathway. The algorithm presented not only captures experimentally observed folding intermediates and kinetics, but yields insights into the relative roles of local and global interactions in determining folding mechanisms and rates.","[Peter, Emanuel Karl; Shea, Joan-Emma] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Shea, JE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",shea@chem.ucsb.edu,,,"Feodor-Lynen grant of the Humboldt-Foundation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1158577, CNS-0960316]; David and Lucile Packard FoundationThe David & Lucile Packard Foundation; Center for Scientific Computing from the CNSI; MRL: an NSF MRSECNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [DMR-1121053]; MRSEC Program of the National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [DMR 1121053]","EP acknowleges support of the Feodor-Lynen grant of the Humboldt-Foundation.

It envisions a cooperative energetic interplay between local conformational preferences and favorable nonlocal contacts. Previous theoretical studies by our group showed that two classes of native-centric coarse-grained models can capture the experimentally observed high degrees of protein folding cooperativity and diversity in folding rates. These models either embody an explicit local-nonlocal coupling mechanism or incorporate desolvation barriers in the models' pairwise interactions. Here a conceptual connection is made between these two paradigmatic coarse-grained interaction schemes by showing that desolvation barriers enhance local-nonlocal coupling. Furthermore, we find that a class of coarse-grained protein models with a single-site representation of sidechains also increases local-nonlocal coupling relative to mainchain models without sidechains. Enhanced local-nonlocal coupling generally leads to higher folding cooperativity and chevron plots with more linear folding arms. For the sidechain models studied, the chevron plot simulated with entirely native-centric intrachain interactions behaves very similarly to the corresponding chevron plots simulated with interactions that are partly modulated by sequence-and denaturant-dependent transfer free energies. In these essentially native-centric models, the mild chevron rollovers in the simulated folding arm are caused by occasionally populated intermediates as well as the movement of the unfolded and putative folding transition states. The strength and limitation of the models are analyzed by comparison with experiment. New formulations of sidechain models that may provide a physical account for nonnative interactions are also explored.","[Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Med Sci Bldg,5th Fl,1 Kings Coll Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,,,Canada Research Chair ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-84281],"H.S.C. thanks Dev Thirumalai for a stimulating discussion during the Dynamics of Biomolecular Machinery workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in China in 2009, and his suggestion to investigate the effects of sidechain interactions on chevron plots.

To explore the biological effects of graphene as one of the most widely used NMs, we studied the adsorption behavior and induced conformational changes of proteins representing different secondary structures on graphene: beta-strands (WW domain), mixed alpha/beta structure (BBA protein), and alpha-helices (lambda-repressor). Our results indicate these model proteins were adsorbed onto the graphene surface quickly and tightly, however, varied degrees of conformational changes were observed. During the adsorption process, we found the beta motif is a stiffer structural unit than the alpha-helix. Moreover, the level of conformational changes of the proteins is related not only to their sequence and structural properties but also to their orientation. Overall, from the different levels of intermolecular interaction, the protein adsorption was driven by van der Waals, hydrophobic and pi-pi stacking interactions. Our work suggests that classical molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA calculations can provide useful information about the dynamics and energetics of the adsorption of proteins onto graphene. We believe that these findings will help us to further understand the adsorption of proteins on hydrophobic carbon nanomaterials at the atomic level.","[Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Qianqian; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jingjing; Yao, Xiaojun; Ning, Lulu; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jingjing; Yao, Xiaojun; Ning, Lulu; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, Dept Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Macau, Peoples R China","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",hxliu@lzu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21375054],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 21375054).

For non-neutral systems, the Ewald algorithm implicitly introduces a uniform background charge distribution that effectively neutralizes the simulation box. Because a uniform distribution of counter charges typically deviates from the spatial distribution of counterions in real systems, artifacts may arise, in particular in systems with an inhomogeneous dielectric constant. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the effect of using an implicit background charge instead of explicit counterions, on the chemical potential of ions in heterogeneous systems, which (i) provides a quantitative criterium for deciding if the background charge offers an acceptable trade-off between artifacts arising from sampling problems and artifacts arising from the homogeneous background charge distribution, and (ii) can be used to correct this artifact in certain cases. Our model quantifies the artifact in terms of the difference in charge density between the non-neutral system with a uniform neutralizing background charge and the real neutral system with a physically correct distribution of explicit counterions. We show that for inhomogeneous systems, such as proteins and membranes in water, the artifact manifests itself by an overstabilization of ions inside the lower dielectric by tens to even hundreds kilojoules per mole. We have tested the accuracy of our model in molecular dynamics simulations and found that the error in the calculated free energy for moving a test charge from water into hexadecane, at different net charges of the system and different simulation box sizes, is correctly predicted by the model. The calculations further confirm that the incorrect distribution of counter charges in the simulation box is solely responsible for the errors in the PMFs.","[Hub, Jochen S.] Univ Gottingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [de Groot, Bert L.; Grubmueller, Helmut; Groenhof, Gerrit] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Computat Biomol Dynam Grp, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Groenhof, Gerrit] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Chem, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Groenhof, Gerrit] Univ Jyvaskyla, Nanosci Ctr, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland","Hub, JS (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Inst Microbiol & Genet, Justus von Liebig Weg 11, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",jhub@gwdg.de; gerrit.x.groenhof@jyu.fi,"Hub, Jochen/M-6230-2015","Hub, Jochen/0000-0001-7716-1767; Groenhof, Gerrit/0000-0001-8148-5334",Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework ProgrammeEuropean Union (EU); Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [HU 1971/1-1]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland,"We thank Gerhard Hummer, Robert van Leeuwen, and Berk Hess for helpful discussions, and Floris Beulens for critically reading the manuscript.

These methods are broadly classified as either structure-based or ligand-based methods. Structure-based methods are in principle analogous to high-throughput screening in that both target and ligand structure information is imperative. Structure-based approaches include ligand docking, pharmacophore, and ligand design methods. The article discusses theory behind the most important methods and recent successful applications. Ligand-based methods use only ligand information for predicting activity depending on its similarity/dissimilarity to previously known active ligands. We review widely used ligand-based methods such as ligand-based pharmacophores, molecular descriptors, and quantitative structure-activity relationships. In addition, important tools such as target/ligand data bases, homology modeling, ligand fingerprint methods, etc., necessary for successful implementation of various computer-aided drug discovery/design methods in a drug discovery campaign are discussed. Finally, computational methods for toxicity prediction and optimization for favorable physiologic properties are discussed with successful examples from literature.","[Sliwoski, Gregory; Kothiwale, Sandeepkumar; Meiler, Jens; Lowe, Edward W., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Meiler Lab, Struct Biol Ctr, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Lowe, EW (corresponding author), BIOSCI MRBIII, Struct Biol Ctr, 465 21st Ave South,Room 5144A, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",edward.w.lowe@vanderbilt.edu,,"Meiler, Jens/0000-0001-8945-193X","National Science Foundation through the Office for Cyber Infrastructure Transformative Computational Sciences Fellowship [OCI-1122919]; National Institutes of Health National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01 MH090192]; National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM099842]; National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R01 DK097376]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [R01DK097376, R01DK097376, R01DK097376] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM099842, R01GM099842, R01GM099842, R01GM099842, R01GM099842, R01GM099842] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH090192, R01MH090192, R01MH090192, R01MH090192] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the National Science Foundation through the Office for Cyber Infrastructure Transformative Computational Sciences Fellowship [OCI-1122919] (E.W.L.); the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Mental Health [Grant R01 MH090192] (to the Meiler laboratory); the National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences [Grant R01 GM099842]; and the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases [Grant R01 DK097376].,,559,571,581,27,430,AMER SOC PHARMACOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS,BETHESDA,"9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814-3995 USA",0031-6997,1521-0081,,PHARMACOL REV,Pharmacol.

It has been found that alpha/beta-type SASP exhibits intrinsic disorder on isolation, but it acquires a defined native state upon binding to DNA. This disorder to order transition is not yet understood. Other questions related to the role of the thermodynamics and structure of the individual protein in the complex formation remain elusive. Characterization of the unbound state of alpha/beta-type SASP in experiments could be a challenging problem because of the heterogeneous nature of the ensemble. Here, computer simulations can help gain more insights into the unbound state of alpha/beta-type SASP. In the present work, by using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), we simulated an alpha/beta-type SASP on isolation with an implicit solvent We found that alpha/beta-type SASP undergoes a continuous phase transition with a small free energy barrier, a common feature of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Additionally, we detected the presence of residual a-helical structures at local level and a high degree of plasticity in the chain which can contribute to the fast disorder to order transition by reducing the fly-casting mechanism.

Terahertz (THz) studies of molecular behavior in binary solutions present unique information on the picosecond motions of molecules. A complete mechanical interpretation of THz absorption spectra associated with solvated biomolecules remains a challenging task. The Gromacs molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package is used here to examine the spectral characteristics of water molecules in close proximity to biomolecules using vibrational density of states (VDOS). Systematic simulation of solvation dynamics of proteins of different size and tertiary structure are presented. The following have been selected for analysis. They range from less to more complex tertiary structure (corresponding to an increased number of secondary structure elements): TRP-cage(13-20) peptide, TRP-cage, BPTI, and lysozyme. The initial study predicts that the depth of the hydration shell, determined by VDOS of water, extends to approximately 10 angstrom and does not depend on protein size. Furthermore the integral perturbation coefficient the whole solvation layer is found to be increased for larger proteins due to a higher retardation rate of water molecules in their shells. Differences in solvation dynamics among the proteins considered originate primarily from the water molecules buried in the interior of the protein and not from the on-surface molecules.","[Sushko, Oleksandr; Dubrovka, Rostyslav; Donnan, Robert S.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, London E1 4NS, England","Donnan, RS (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",robert.donnan@eecs.qmul.ac.uk,"Dubrovka, Rostyslav/R-4712-2019; Sushko, Oleksandr/I-4011-2018","Dubrovka, Rostyslav/0000-0001-6900-1819; Sushko, Oleksandr/0000-0001-7738-6421",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I014845/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,32,16,16,2,60,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

Naritomi and S. Fuchigami, J. Chem. Phys. 134, 065101 (2011)]. Our previous study focused on domain motions of the protein and examined its dynamics by using rigid-body domain analysis and tICA. However, the protein changes its conformation not only through domain motions but also by various types of motions involving its backbone and side chains. Some of these motions might occur on a slow time scale: we hypothesize that if so, we could effectively detect and characterize them using tICA. In the present study, we investigated slow dynamics of the protein backbone using MD simulation and tICA. The selected target protein was lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAO), which comprises two domains and undergoes large domain motions. MD simulation of LAO in explicit water was performed for 1 mu s, and the obtained trajectory of C-alpha atoms in the backbone was analyzed by tICA. This analysis successfully provided us with slow modes for LAO that represented either domain motions or local movements of the backbone. Further analysis elucidated the atomic details of the suggested local motions and confirmed that these motions truly occurred on the expected slow time scale.

However, the mechanisms by which conformational signals move between signalling elements within a receptor dimer and how they control kinase activity remain unknown. Here, using long molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the kinase-activating cytoplasmic tip of the chemoreceptor fluctuates between two stable conformations in a signal-dependent manner. A highly conserved residue, Phe396, appears to serve as the conformational switch, because flipping of the stacked aromatic rings of an interacting F396-F396' pair in the receptor homodimer takes place concomitantly with the signal-related conformational changes. We suggest that interacting aromatic residues, which are common stabilizers of protein tertiary structure, might serve as rotameric molecular switches in other biological processes as well.","[Ortega, Davi R.; Zhulin, Igor B.] Univ Tennessee, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Joint Inst Computat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37861 USA; [Yang, Chen; Ames, Peter; Parkinson, John S.] Univ Utah, Dept Biol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Baudry, Jerome] Univ Tennessee, Dept Biochem & Cellular & Mol Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Baudry, Jerome] Univ Tennessee, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Biophys Mol, Oak Ridge, TN 37861 USA; [Zhulin, Igor B.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Microbiol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Zhulin, Igor B.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Math & Comp Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37861 USA","Zhulin, IB (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Joint Inst Computat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37861 USA.",jbaudry@utk.edu; joulineib@ornl.gov,"Zhulin, Igor B/A-2308-2012; Zhulin, Igor/T-3509-2019","Zhulin, Igor B/0000-0002-6708-5323; Zhulin, Igor/0000-0002-6708-5323","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM072285, GM19559]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [PSCA00026P]; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R01GM019559, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R01GM072285, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R37GM019559, R01GM072285, R01GM072285, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM072285, R01GM072285, R37GM019559, R01GM019559, R01GM019559] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank G.L.

In the current work, it is demonstrated that in energy-based prediction methods, the degree of optimization of the sampled structures can influence the prediction results. In particular, discrepancies in the degree of local sampling can bias the predictions in favor of the oversampled structures by shifting the local probability distributions of the minimum sampled energies. In simple systems, it is shown that the magnitude of the errors can be calculated from the energy surface, and for certain model systems, derived analytically. Further, it is shown that for energy wells whose forms differ only by a randomly assigned energy shift, the optimal accuracy of prediction is achieved when the sampling around each structure is equal. Energy correction terms can be used in cases of unequal sampling to reproduce the total probabilities that would occur under equal sampling, but optimal corrections only partially restore the prediction accuracy lost to unequal sampling. For multiwell systems, the determination of the correction terms is a multibody problem; it is shown that the involved cross-correlation multiple integrals can be reduced to simpler integrals. The possible implications of the current analysis for macromolecular structure prediction are discussed.","[Petrella, Robert J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Petrella, Robert J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Petrella, RJ (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",petrella@fas.harvard.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 RR023920, R01 GM103695]","The author thanks Professor Martin Karplus of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard for his reading of the manuscript and for his support.

Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A. 2012, 109, 17845]. From the obtained profiles, we directly determine such basic properties of folding dynamics as the configurations of the minima and transition states (TS), the formation of secondary structure and hydrophobic core during the folding process, the value of the pre-exponential factor and its relation to the transition path times, the relation between the autocorrelation times in TS and minima. We also present an investigation of the accuracy of the pre-exponential factor estimation based on the transition-path times. Four different estimations of the pre-exponential factor for both proteins give K-0(-1) values of approximately a few tens of nanoseconds. Our analysis gives detailed information about folding of the proteins and can serve as a rigorous common language for extensive comparison between experiment and simulation.","[Banushkina, Polina V.; Krivov, Sergei V.] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Krivov, SV (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.krivov@leeds.ac.uk,,,RCUK fellowshipResearch Councils UK (RCUK); BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/J016055/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/J016055/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"The work has been supported in part by an RCUK fellowship and a BBSRC grant (No. BB/J016055/1).

HHC-36 (KRWWKWWRR) is a simple but effective antimicrobial peptide with similar or superior activity compared with several conventional antibiotics. In this biophysical study, unique conformational properties of this peptide and some of its analogs as well as its interaction with lipid membranes are investigated in detail. Circular dichroism (CD) and molecular dynamics modeling studies of HHC-36 in different environments reveal a dynamic amphipathic structure composed of competing turn conformations with free energies lower than that of the unfolded state, implying a strong influence of tryptophan interactions in formation of the turns. CD spectra and gel electrophoresis also show strong evidence of self-association of this peptide in aqueous milieu and interaction with both neutrally and negatively charged lipid membrane systems. Isothermal titration calorimetry and acrylamide fluorescence quenching experiments emphasize the preference of HHC-36 for negatively charged vesicles. In addition, dye leakage experiments suggest that this peptide functions through a surface- associated mechanism with weak lytic activity against bacterial model membranes.","[Nichols, Matthew; Kuljanin, Miljan; Hoang, Tuan; DeBruin, Lillian; Jelokhani-Niaraki, Masoud] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Nategholeslam, Mostafa; Vafaei, Shaghayegh; Tomberli, Bruno; Gray, C.

Dilution into folding conditions initiates a fast molecular collapse into a polyglobular conformation (< 20 ms), determined by various methods including small angle X-ray scattering. The compaction produces a structurally heterogeneous state with widespread low-level HX protection and spectroscopic signals that match the equilibrium melting posttransition-state baseline. In a much slower step (7-s time constant), all of the MBP molecules, although initially heterogeneously structured, form the same distinct helix plus sheet folding intermediate with the same time constant. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein where they close the longest residue-to-residue contact. Segments that are most HX protected in the early molecular collapse do not contribute to the initial intermediate, whereas the segments that do participate are among the less protected. The 7-s intermediate persists through the rest of the folding process. It contains the sites of three previously reported destabilizing mutations that greatly slow folding. These results indicate that the intermediate is an obligatory step on the MBP folding pathway. MBP then folds to the native state on a longer time scale (similar to 100 s), suggestively in more than one step, the first of which forms structure adjacent to the 7-s intermediate. These results add a large protein to the list of proteins known to fold through distinct native- like intermediates in distinct pathways.","[Walters, Benjamin T.; Mayne, Leland; Englander, S.

However, the multidimensional nature of the free energy landscape makes it difficult to describe. We propose to use a weighted-graph approach to depict the free energy landscape with the nodes on the graph representing the conformational states and the edge weights reflecting the free energy barriers between the states. Our graph is constructed from a molecular dynamics trajectory and does not involve projecting the multi-dimensional free energy landscape onto a low-dimensional space defined by a few order parameters. The calculation of free energy barriers was based on transition-path theory using the MSMBuilder2 package. We compare our graph with the widely used transition disconnectivity graph (TRDG) which is constructed from the same trajectory and show that our approach gives more accurate description of the free energy landscape than the TRDG approach even though the latter can be organized into a simple tree representation. The weighted-graph is a general approach and can be used on any complex system.

However, MSMs approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from MSMs can be computed from HMMs/PMMs. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton MD simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an RNA hairpin.

Molecular dynamics simulations offered atomic-level descriptions of the forced unfolding. However, experiment and simulation could not be directly compared because they differed in pulling velocity by orders of magnitude. We have developed high-speed force spectroscopy to unfold titin at velocities reached by simulation (similar to 4 millimeters per second). We found that a small beta-strand pair of an immunoglobulin domain dynamically unfolds and refolds, buffering pulling forces up to similar to 100 piconewtons. The distance to the unfolding transition barrier is larger than previously estimated but is in better agreement with atomistic predictions. The ability to directly compare experiment and simulation is likely to be important in studies of biomechanical processes.","[Rico, Felix; Casuso, Ignacio; Scheuring, Simon] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, U1006, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Gonzalez, Laura; Puig-Vidal, Manel] Univ Barcelona, Dept Elect, Bioelect Grp, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Scheuring, S (corresponding author), Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, U1006, Parc Sci & Technol Luminy,163 Ave Luminy, F-13009 Marseille, France.",simon.scheuring@inserm.fr,"Rico, Felix/K-6505-2012; Scheuring, Simon/L-9843-2018; Vidal, Manuel Puig/N-5017-2014; Casuso, Ignacio/E-5574-2016","Rico, Felix/0000-0002-7757-8340; Scheuring, Simon/0000-0003-3534-069X; Vidal, Manuel Puig/0000-0002-6074-9246; Casuso, Ignacio/0000-0001-7192-0136; Gonzalez-Claramonte, Laura/0000-0002-1422-2734",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [310080]; Agence National de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-12-BS10-009-01]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [BES-2010-031186]; STSM COST Action [TD1002-10006],We thank A.

In ab-initio structure prediction, in particular, where the goal is to predict the native structure of a protein chain given its amino-acid sequence, the ensemble needs to satisfy energetic constraints. Given the thermodynamic hypothesis, an effective ensemble contains low-energy conformations which are similar to the native structure. The high-dimensionality of the conformational space and the ruggedness of the underlying energy surface currently make it very difficult to obtain such an ensemble. Recent studies have proposed that Basin Hopping is a promising probabilistic search framework to obtain a discrete representation of the protein energy surface in terms of local minima. Basin Hopping performs a series of structural perturbations followed by energy minimizations with the goal of hopping between nearby energy minima. This approach has been shown to be effective in obtaining conformations near the native structure for small systems. Recent work by us has extended this framework to larger systems through employment of the molecular fragment replacement technique, resulting in rapid sampling of large ensembles. Methods: This paper investigates the algorithmic components in Basin Hopping to both understand and control their effect on the sampling of near-native minima. Realizing that such an ensemble is reduced before further refinement in full ab-initio protocols, we take an additional step and analyze the quality of the ensemble retained by ensemble reduction techniques. We propose a novel multi-objective technique based on the Pareto front to filter the ensemble of sampled local minima. Results and conclusions: We show that controlling the magnitude of the perturbation allows directly controlling the distance between consecutively-sampled local minima and, in turn, steering the exploration towards conformations near the native structure. For the minimization step, we show that the addition of Metropolis Monte Carlo-based minimization is no more effective than a simple greedy search. Finally, we show that the size of the ensemble of sampled local minima can be effectively and efficiently reduced by a multi-objective filter to obtain a simpler representation of the probed energy surface.","[Olson, Brian S.; Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Dept Bioengn, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Manassas, VA 20110 USA","Shehu, A (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",amarda@gmu.edu,,"Shehu, Amarda/0000-0001-5230-4610",NSF CCF [1016995]; NSF IIS CAREER Award [1144106]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1144106] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,This work is supported in part by NSF CCF No. 1016995 and NSF IIS CAREER Award No. 1144106.,,47,1,1,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1477-5956,,PROTEOME SCI,Proteome Sci.,NOV 7,2013,11,,,1,,,,,S12,10.1186/1477-5956-11-S1-S12,,,16,Biochemical Research Methods,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,270OF,WOS:000328327300012,24564970,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

By using simulations with a structure-based model and a rigorous methodology to determine free-energy surfaces from trajectories, we evaluate the effect of a circular permutation on the free-energy landscape of the protein T4 lysozyme. We observe changes which, although subtle, largely affect the cooperativity between the two subdomains. Such a change in cooperativity has been previously experimentally observed and recently also characterized using single molecule optical tweezers and the Crooks relation. The free-energy landscapes show that both the wild type and circular permutant have an on-pathway intermediate, previously experimentally characterized, in which one of the subdomains is completely formed. The landscapes, however, differ in the position of the rate-limiting step for folding, which occurs before the intermediate in the wild type and after in the circular permutant. This shift of transition state explains the observed change in the cooperativity. The underlying free-energy landscape thus provides a microscopic description of the folding dynamics and the connection between circular permutation and the loss of cooperativity experimentally observed.","[Radou, Gael; Enciso, Marta; Krivov, Sergei; Paci, Emanuele] Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Paci, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",e.paci@leeds.ac.uk,"Paci, Emanuele/B-1893-2010","Paci, Emanuele/0000-0002-4891-2768",Wellcome Trust PhD studentshipWellcome Trust [096686/Z/11/Z]; Spanish Ministerio de EducacionSpanish Government,"This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship (to G.R.)

Using equilibrium analysis and autocorrelation analysis of the time traces, the full energetics as well as real-time kinetics of the ultrafast folding of villin headpiece 35 and a stable asparagine 68 alanine/lysine 70 methionine variant can be measured directly. We also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the response of the bead-DNA system to protein-folding fluctuations. All key features of the force-dependent deflection fluctuations could be reproduced: SD, skewness, and autocorrelation function. Our measurements reveal a difference in folding pathway and cooperativity between wild-type and stable variant of headpiece 35.

In the 1970s, Aaron Ciechanover, Avram Hershko, and Irwin Rose discovered that certain proteins are tagged by ubiquitin before degradation, a discovery that awarded them the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Compelling data gathered during the last several decades show that ubiquitin plays a vital role not only in protein degradation but also in many cellular functions including DNA repair processes, cell cycle regulation, cell growth, immune system functionality, hormone-mediated signaling in plants, vesicular trafficking pathways, regulation of histone modification and viral budding. Due to the involvement of ubiquitin in such a large number of diverse cellular processes, flaws and impairments in the ubiquitin system were found to be linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, genetic disorders, and immunological disorders. Hence, deciphering the dynamics and complexity of the ubiquitin system is of significant importance. In addition to experimental techniques, computational methodologies have been gaining increasing influence in protein research and are used to uncover the structure, stability, folding, mechanism of action and interactions of proteins. Notably, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations have become powerful tools that bridge the gap between structure and function while providing dynamic insights and illustrating essential mechanistic characteristics. In this study, we present an overview of molecular modeling and simulations of ubiquitin and the ubiquitin system, evaluate the status of the field, and offer our perspective on future progress in this area of research.

Due to its simplicity and the availability of thermodynamic and kinetic experimental data, cyc-RKAAAD poses as an ideal model for evaluating the aptness of current molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodologies to accurately sample conformations that reproduce experimentally observed properties. In this work, we extensively sample the conformational space of cyc-RKAAAD using microsecond-timescale MD simulations. We characterize the peptide conformational preferences in terms of secondary structure propensities and, using Cartesian-coordinate principal component analysis (cPCA), construct its free energy landscape, thus obtaining a detailed weighted discrimination between the helical and nonhelical subensembles. The cPCA state discrimination, together with a Markov model built from it, allowed us to estimate the free energy of unfolding (-0.57 kJ/mol) and the relaxation time (similar to 0.435 mu s) at 298.15 K, which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally reported values (-0.22 kJ/mol and 0.42 mu s, Serrano, A.

Additionally, we present simulations conducted using two enhanced sampling methods: replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and bias-exchange metadynamics (BE-MetaD). We compare the free energy landscape obtained by these two methods with the results from MD simulations and discuss the sampling and computational gains achieved. Overall, the results obtained attest to the suitability of modern simulation methods to explore the conformational behavior of peptide systems with a high level of realism.","[Damas, Joao M.; Filipe, Luis C.

These can derive from both simulations and measurements. Analysis of such data requires the availability of scalable algorithms. In this contribution, we propose a scalable algorithm that partitions instantaneous observations (snapshots) of a complex system into kinetically distinct sets (termed basins). To do so, we use a combination of ordering snapshots employing the method's only essential parameter, i.e., a definition of pairwise distance, and annotating the resultant sequence, the so-called progress index, in different ways. Specifically, we propose a combination of cut-based and structural annotations with the former responsible for the kinetic grouping and the latter for diagnostics and interpretation. The method is applied to an illustrative test case, and the scaling of an approximate version is demonstrated to be O (N log N) with N being the number of snapshots. Two real-world data sets from river hydrology measurements and protein folding simulations are then used to highlight the utility of the method in finding basins for complex systems. Both limitations and benefits of the approach are discussed along with routes for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The answer to this question has important implications for our understanding of why many small proteins fold with two state kinetics. When the equilibration within the unfolded state U is much faster than the folding, the folding kinetics will be two state even if there are many folding pathways with different barriers. Yet the mean first passage times (MFPTs) between different regions of the unfolded state can be much longer than the folding time. This seems to imply that the equilibration within U is much slower than the folding. In this communication we resolve this paradox. We present a formula for estimating the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of a protein. We also present a formula for the MFPT to any state within U, which is proportional to the average lifetime of that state divided by the state population. This relation is valid when the equilibration within U is very fast as compared with folding as it often is for small proteins. To illustrate the concepts, we apply the formulas to estimate the time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage and MFPTs within the unfolded state based on a Markov State Model using an ultra-long 208 microsecond trajectory of the miniprotein to parameterize the model. The time to equilibrate the unfolded state of Trp-cage is similar to 100ns while the typical MFPTs within U are tens of microseconds or longer.","[Levy, Ronald M.; Deng, Nan-Jie] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Dai, Wei] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; [Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Levy, RM (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",ronlevy@lutece.rutgers.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM30580]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1266380]; Division Of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1266380] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Grant sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Grant number: GM30580; Grant sponsor: National Science Foundation; Grant number: CHE-1266380.,,36,16,16,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,NOV,2013,22,11,,,,,1459,1465,,10.1002/pro.2335,,,7,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,239LI,WOS:000326025100001,23963761,Green Published,,,2020-11-19,

The initiation of refolding reactions has been achieved by several means, including temperature jumps, flash photolysis, pressure jumps, and rapid mixing methods. One of the most commonly used means of initiating refolding of chemically denatured proteins is by turbulent flow mixing with refolding dilution buffer, where greater than 99% mixing efficiency has been achieved within 10's of microseconds. Successful interfacing of turbulent flow mixers with complementary detection methods, including time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy (trFL), Forster Resonance Energy Transfer, Circular Dichroism, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering, Hydrogen Exchange followed by Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), and Fourier Transform IR Spectroscopy, has made this technique very attractive for monitoring various aspects of structure formation during folding. Although continuous-flow (CF) mixing devices interfaced with trFL detection have a dead time of only 30 mu s, burst phases have been detected in this time scale during folding of peptides and of large proteins (e.g., CheY and TIM barrels). Furthermore, a major limitation of the CF mixing technique has been the requirement of large quantities of sample. In this brief communication, we will discuss the recent flurry of activity in micromachining and microfluidics, guided by computational simulations, which are likely to lead to dramatic improvements in time resolution and sample consumption for CF mixers over the next few years.

One factor to control the breadth of T cell responses is the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex. Here, we present an in silica protocol for predicting peptide-MHC structure. A robust signature of a conformational transition was identified during all-atom molecular dynamics, which results in a model with high accuracy. A large test set was used in constructing our protocol and we went another step further using a blind test with a wild-type peptide and two highly immunogenic mutants, which predicted substantial conformational changes in both mutants. The center residues at position five of the analogs were configured to be accessible to solvent, forming a prominent surface, while the residue of the wild-type peptide was to point laterally toward the side of the binding cleft. We then experimentally determined the structures of the blind test set, using high resolution of X-ray crystallography, which verified predicted conformational changes. Our observation strongly supports a positive association of the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex to its immunogenicity. Our study offers the prospect of enhancing immunogenicity of vaccines by identifying MHC binding immunogens. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding(3,4). Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions(5). Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for alpha-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions(2). It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system.","[Chung, Hoi Sung; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Chung, HS (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov; eaton@helix.nih.gov,"Chung, Hoi Sung/C-2624-2009","Chung, Hoi Sung/0000-0001-6897-4969","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055, ZIADK029055] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We are particularly indebted to J.

This is an experimentally demanding process where chemical intuition usually serves as a guide for the choice of amino acid residues to mutate. Such an approach can be aided by computational methods that screen for protein engineering hot spots. Here we present one such method that involves sampling the energy landscape of the pseudo-wild-type protein and investigating the effect of point mutations on this landscape. Using a novel metric for the cooperativity, we identify those residues leading to the least cooperative folding. The folding dynamics of the selected mutants are then directly characterized and the differences in the kinetics are analyzed within a Markov-state model framework. Although the method is general, here we present results for a coarse-grained topology-based simulation model of lambda-repressor, whose barrier is reduced from an initial value of similar to 4k(B)T at the midpoint to similar to 1k(B)T, thereby reaching the downhill folding regime.","[Carter, James W.; Baker, Christopher M.; De Sancho, David] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","De Sancho, D (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",dd363@cam.ac.uk,"Baker, Christopher/A-5264-2010; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; De Sancho, David/C-4995-2009","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; De Sancho, David/0000-0002-8985-2685","Trinity Hall Cambridge; Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS); Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); FEBS; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J016764/1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",J.W.C. acknowledges support from Trinity Hall Cambridge.

We find that the collective fraction of native amino acid contacts, Q, captures remarkably well the transition states for all the proteins with a folding free energy barrier. Going beyond this global picture, we devise two different measures to quantify the importance of individual interresidue contacts in the folding mechanism: (i) the log-ratio of lifetimes of contacts during folding transition paths and in the unfolded state and (ii) a Bayesian measure of how predictive the formation of each contact is for being on a transition path. Both of these measures indicate that native, or near-native, contacts are important for determining mechanism, as might be expected. More remarkably, however, we found that for almost all the proteins, with the designed protein alpha D-3 being a notable exception, nonnative contacts play no significant part in determining folding mechanisms.","[Best, Robert B.; Hummer, Gerhard; Eaton, William A.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,"Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X; Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK029054, ZIADK075104, ZIADK029054, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK029054, ZIADK075104, ZIADK029054, ZIADK029054, ZIADK029054, ZIADK075104, ZIADK029054, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank D.E.

Isolated protein domains, however, are rarely observed in vivo, where multidomain proteins and multimeric assemblies are far more common. It is clear that the folding of such proteins is often inextricably coupled with the process of dimerization; indeed, many protein monomers and protein domains are not stable in isolation, and fold to their native structures only when stabilized by interactions with other members of a protein complex. Here, we use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an aggregate simulation length of 4 ms to elucidate key aspects of the folding mechanism, and of the associated free-energy surface, of the Top7-CFr dimer, a 114-amino-acid protein homodimer with a mixed alpha/beta structure. In these simulations, we observed a number of folding and unfolding events. Each folding event was characterized by the assembly of two unfolded Top7-CFr monomers to form a stable, folded dimer. We found that the isolated monomer is unstable but that, early in the folding pathway, nascent native structure is stabilized by contacts between the two monomer subunits. These contacts are in some cases native, as in an induced-folding model, and in other cases non-native, as in a fly-casting mechanism. Occasionally, folding by conformational selection, in which both subunits form independently before dimerization, was also observed. Folding then proceeds through the sequential addition of strands to the protein beta sheet. Although the long-time-scale relaxation of the folding process can be well described by a single exponential, these simulations reveal the presence of a number of kinetic traps, characterized by structures in which individual strands are added in an incorrect order.","[Piana, Stefano; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten; Shawa, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shawa, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinforrnat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Piana, S (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039",D.

However, their high working concentration in combination with their strong absorption in the far ultraviolet region make it impossible to measure high quality circular dichroism or infrared spectra, which are commonly used to detect changes in protein secondary structure. On the other hand, detergents such as dodecyl sulfate destabilize native protein conformation at low millimolar concentrations and are UV transparent, but they denature proteins more gradually than guanidinium or urea. In this work, we studied the denaturation properties of the fungicide dodecylguanidinium acetate (dodine), which combines both denaturants into one. We show that dodine unfolds some small proteins at millimolar concentrations, facilitates temperature denaturation, and is transparent enough at its working concentration, unlike guanidinium, to measure full range circular dichroism spectra.

Unbiased, independent simulations with PACE are found to achieve together multiple folding and unfolding events for both proteins, allowing us to perform network analysis of the FESs to identify folding pathways. PACE reproduces for both proteins expected complexity hidden in the folding FESs, in particular metastable non-native intermediates. Pathway analysis shows that some of these intermediates are, actually, on-pathway folding intermediates and that intermediates kinetically closest to the native states can be either critical on-pathway or off-pathway intermediates, depending on the protein. Apart from general insights into folding, specific folding mechanisms of the proteins are resolved. We find that Tip-cage folds via a dominant pathway in which hydrophobic collapse occurs before the N-terminal helix forms; full incorporation of Trp6 into the hydrophobic core takes place as the last step of folding, which, however, may not be the rate-limiting step. For the WW-domain variant studied, we observe two main folding pathways with opposite orders of formation of the two hairpins involved in the structure; for either pathway, formation of hairpin I is more likely to be the rate-limiting step. Altogether, our results suggest that PACE combined with network analysis is a computationally efficient and valuable tool for the study of protein folding.","[Han, Wei; Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois,

Here we employ three different models to analyze the unfolded landscape and folding kinetics of the miniprotein Trp-cage. The first is a 208 mu s explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from D. E. Shaw Research containing tens of folding events. The second is a Markov state model (MSM-MD) constructed from the same ultralong MD simulation; MSM-MD can be used to generate thousands of folding events. The third is a Markov state model built from temperature replica exchange MD simulations in implicit solvent (MSM-REMD). All the models exhibit multiple folding pathways, and there is a good correspondence between the folding pathways from direct MD and those computed from the MSMs. The unfolded populations interconvert rapidly between extended and collapsed conformations on time scales <= 40 ns, compared with the folding time of similar to 5 mu s. The folding rates are independent of where the folding is initiated from within the unfolded ensemble. About 90% of the unfolded states are sampled within the first 40 mu s of the ultralong MD trajectory, which on average explores similar to 27% of the unfolded state ensemble between consecutive folding events. We clustered the folding pathways according to structural similarity into tubes, and kinetically partitioned the unfolded state into populations that fold along different tubes. From our analysis of the simulations and a simple kinetic model, we find that, when the mixing within the unfolded state is comparable to or faster than folding, the folding waiting times for all the folding tubes are similar and the folding kinetics is essentially single exponential despite the presence of heterogeneous folding paths with nonuniform barriers. When the mixing is much slower than folding, different unfolded populations fold independently, leading to nonexponential kinetics. A kinetic partition of the Trp-cage unfolded state is constructed which reveals that different unfolded populations have almost the same probability to fold along any of the multiple folding paths. We are investigating whether the results for the kinetics in the unfolded state of the 20-residue Trp-cage is representative of larger single domain proteins.","[Levy, Ronald M.] Rutgers State Univ, BioMaPS Inst Quantitat Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Levy, RM (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, BioMaPS Inst Quantitat Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",ronlevy@lutece.rutgers.edu,,,"National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM30580]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work has been supported by a grant from the National Institute of Health (GM30580).

RNA tetraloops with loop sequences UUCG, GCAA, or CUUG are hyperstable because of the formation of noncanonical loop-stabilizing interactions, and they are all faithfully reproduced to angstrom-level accuracy in replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, including explicit solvent and ion molecules. This accuracy is accomplished using unique RNA parameters, in which biases that favor rigid, highly stacked conformations are corrected to accurately capture the inherent flexibility of ssRNA loops, accurate base stacking energetics, and purine syn-anti inter-conversions. In a departure from traditional quantum chemistry-centric approaches to force field optimization, our parameters are calibrated directly from thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of intra-and internucleotide structural transitions. The ability to recapitulate the signature noncanonical interactions of the three most abundant hyperstable stem loop motifs represents a significant milestone to the accurate prediction of RNA tertiary structure using unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.","[Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys, Troy, NY 12180 USA; Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, Troy, NY 12180 USA","Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",angel@rpi.edu,"Chen, Alan/D-6940-2014","Chen, Alan/0000-0001-8246-2935","National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship [F32GM091774]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1050966]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [F32GM091774, F32GM091774, F32GM091774] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","A.A.C. is supported by National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship F32GM091774, and A.

Recently, we reported rat AFP binding affinities for a large set of structurally diverse chemicals, including 53 binders and 72 non-binders. However, the lack of three-dimensional (3D) structures of rat AFP hinders further understanding of the structural dependence for binding. Therefore, a 3D structure of rat AFP was built using homology modeling in order to elucidate rat AFP-ligand binding modes through docking analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Methods: Homology modeling was first applied to build a 3D structure of rat AFP. Molecular docking and Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) scoring were then used to examine potential rat AFP ligand binding modes. MD simulations and free energy calculations were performed to refine models of binding modes. Results: A rat AFP tertiary structure was first obtained using homology modeling and MD simulations. The rat AFP-ligand binding modes of 13 structurally diverse, representative binders were calculated using molecular docking, (MM-GBSA) ranking and MD simulations. The key residues for rat AFP-ligand binding were postulated through analyzing the binding modes. Conclusion: The optimized 3D rat AFP structure and associated ligand binding modes shed light on rat AFP-ligand binding interactions that, in turn, provide a means to estimate binding affinity of unknown chemicals. Our results will assist in the evaluation of the endocrine disruption potential of chemicals.","[Shen, Jie; Zhang, Wenqian; Perkins, Roger; Tong, Weida; Hong, Huixiao] US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA; [Fang, Hong] US FDA, Off Sci Coordinat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA","Hong, HX (corresponding author), US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA.",huixiao.hong@fda.hhs.gov,,,,,,45,44,46,0,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,OCT 9,2013,14,,,14,,,,,S6,10.1186/1471-2105-14-S14-S6,,,11,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,249AA,WOS:000326747100006,24266910,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

Due to its small size and fast folding, it is an ideal model system for experimental and theoretical investigations of protein folding mechanisms. However, Trp-cage's exact folding mechanism is still a matter of debate.,Here we investigate Trp-cage's relaxation dynamics in the amide I' spectral region (1530- 1700 cm(-1)) using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Residue-specific information was obtained by incorporating an isotopic label (C-13=O-18) into the amide carbonyl group of residue Gly11, thereby spectrally isolating an individual 3(10)-helical residue. The folding unfolding equilibrium is perturbed using a nanosecond temperature jump (T jump), and the subsequent re-equilibration is probed by observing the time dependent vibrational response in the amide I' region. We observe bimodal relaxation kinetics with time constants of 100 +/- 10 and 770 +/- 40 ns at 322 K, suggesting that the folding involves an intermediate state, the character of which can be determined from the time and frequency resolved data We find that the relaxation dynamics close to the melting temperature involve fast fluctuations in the polyproline II region, whereas the slower process can be attributed to conformational rearrangements due to the global (un)folding transition of the protein. Combined analysis of our T-jump data and molecular dynamics simulations indicates that the formation of a well-defined alpha-helix precedes the rapid formation of the hydrophobic cage structure, implying a native like folding intermediate, that Mainly differs from the folded conformation in the orientation of the C-terminal polyproline II helix relative to the N-terminal part of the backbone., We find that the main free energy barrier is positioned between the folding intermediate and the unfolded state ensemble, and that it involves the formation of the alpha-helix, the 3(10)-helix, and the Asp9- Arg16 salt bridge. Our results suggest that at low temperature (T << T-m) a folding path via formation of alpha-helical contacts followed by hydrophobic clustering becomes more important.","[Meuzelaar, Heleen; Marino, Kristen A.; Huerta-Viga, Adriana; Panman, Matthijs R.; Smeenk, Linde E.

They fold into ordered structures upon binding to their partner molecules. Currently, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of how coupled binding and folding occurs in MoREs. Here, we quantified the unbound ensembles of the alpha-MoRE within the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein. We developed a multiscaled approach by combining a physics-based and an atomic hybrid model to decipher the mechanism by which the alpha-MoRE interacts with the X domain of the measles virus phosphoprotein. Our multiscaled approach led to remarkable qualitative and quantitative agreements between the theoretical predictions and experimental results (e.g., chemical shifts). We found that the free alpha-MoRE rapidly interconverts between multiple discrete partially helical conformations and the unfolded state, in accordance with the experimental observations. We quantified the underlying global folding-binding landscape. This leads to a synergistic mechanism in which the recognition event proceeds via (minor) conformational selection, followed by (major) induced folding. We also provided evidence that the alpha-MoRE is a compact molten globule-like IDP and behaves as a downhill folder in the induced folding process. We further provided a theoretical explanation for the inherent connections between downhill folding, molten globule, and intrinsic disorder in IDP-related systems. Particularly, we proposed that binding and unbinding of IDPs proceed in a stepwise way through a kinetic divide-and-conquer strategy that confers them high specificity without high affinity.","[Wang, Yong; Wang, Erkang; Wang, Jin] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Changchun 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xiakun; Han, Wei; Wang, Jin] Jilin Univ, Coll Phys, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Chu, Xiakun; Han, Wei; Wang, Jin] Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Superhard Mat, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Longhi, Sonia] CNRS, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Longhi, Sonia] Aix Marseille Univ, Unite Mixte Rech 7257, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Roche, Philippe] Inst J Paoli I Calmettes, INSERM Unite 1068, CNRS Unite Mixte Rech 7258, Ctr Rech Cancerol Marseille, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Roche, Philippe] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Wang, Jin] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem & Phys, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Wang, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Changchun 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China.",jin.wang.1@stonybrook.edu,"Chu, Xiakun/AAE-9442-2019; , 汪尔康/P-1748-2019; Wang, Yong/J-3990-2012; LONGHI, Sonia/M-5305-2014","Chu, Xiakun/0000-0003-3166-7070; Wang, Yong/0000-0001-9156-0377; LONGHI, Sonia/0000-0002-6829-6771","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21190040, 11174105, 91227114]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-08-PCVI-0020-01]","Y.W. thanks Dr. Ludovico Sutto for help on the construction of the hybrid structure-based model and for providing the data of SH3.

In recent years NMR methods have also been developed to study protein folding as it might occur within the cell, in a de novo manner, by observing the folding of nascent polypeptides in the process of emerging from the ribosome during synthesis. Despite the 2.3 MDa molecular weight of the bacterial 70S ribosome, many nascent polypeptides, and some ribosomal proteins, have sufficient local flexibility that sharp resonances may be observed in solution-state NMR spectra. In providing information on dynamic regions of the structure, NMR spectroscopy is therefore highly complementary to alternative methods such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, which have successfully characterized the rigid core of the ribosome particle. However, the low working concentrations and limited sample stability associated with ribosome-nascent chain complexes means that such studies still present significant technical challenges to the NMR spectroscopist. This review will discuss the progress that has been made in this area, surveying all NMR studies that have been published to date, and with a particular focus on strategies for improving experimental sensitivity.

While past theoretical work has yielded apt descriptions of protein folding landscapes, recent large-scale simulations have provided insights into protein folding that were impractical to obtain from early theories. In particular, the role that non-native contacts play in protein folding, and their relation to the existence of misfolded, beta-sheet rich trap states on folding landscapes, has emerged as a topic of interest in the field. In this paper, we present a modified model of heteropolymer freezing that includes explicit secondary structural characteristics which allow observations of intramolecular amyloid states to be probed from a theoretical perspective. We introduce a variable persistence length-based energy penalty to a model Hamiltonian, and we illustrate how this modification alters the phase transitions present in the theory. We find, in particular, that inclusion of this variable persistence length increases both generic freezing and folding temperatures in the model, allowing both folding and glass transitions to occur in a more highly optimized fashion. We go on to discuss how these changes might relate to protein evolution, misfolding, and the emergence of intramolecular amyloid states.

However, the initial (submillisecond) stages of folding still represent a formidable analytical challenge. A number of ultrarapid triggering techniques have been available for some time, but coupling of these techniques with detection methods that are capable of providing detailed structural information has proven to be difficult. The current work addresses this issue by combining submillisecond mixing with laser-induced oxidative labeling. Apomyoglobin (aMb) serves as a model system for our measurements. Exposure of the protein to a brief pulse of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) at different time points during folding introduces covalent modifications at solvent accessible side chains. The extent of labeling is monitored using mass spectrometry-based peptide mapping, providing spatially resolved measurements of changes in solvent accessibility. The submillisecond mixer used here improves the time resolution by a factor of 50 compared to earlier center dot OH labeling experiments from our laboratory. Data obtained in this way indicate that early aMb folding events are driven by both local and sequence-remote docking of hydrophobic side chains. Assembly of a partially formed A(E)G(H) scaffold after 0.2 ms is followed by stepwise consolidation that ultimately yields the native state. Major conformational changes go to completion within 0.1 s. The technique introduced here is capable of providing in-depth structural information on very short time scales that have thus far been dominated by low resolution (global) spectroscopic probes. By employing submillisecond mixing in conjunction with slower mixing techniques, it is possible to observe complete folding pathways, from fractions of a millisecond all the way to minutes.","[Konermann, Lars] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Konermann, L (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",konerman@uwo.ca,"Vahidi, Siavash/I-4957-2012","Vahidi, Siavash/0000-0001-8637-3710; Stocks, Bradley/0000-0002-7265-9344",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,"Funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and the Canada Research Chairs Program.

In this paper, we report for the first time all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations investigating the structural and dynamic properties of a noncovalent bioconjugate in which the monoclonal Cetuximab antibody (Ctx) is adsorbed on a CNT surface. Upon selection of the three most representative adsorption modes as obtained by docking studies, force-field MD and DFT simulations unambiguously showed that hydrophobic interactions mainly govern the adsorption of the protein on the graphitic surface. Two main adsorption poses have been predicted: a pose-fab (p-fab) and pose-fc (p-fc) (fab = fragment antigen binding region; fc = fragment crystallizable region), the former being favored with small-diameter tubes (40 angstrom). In all the predicted poses, the secondary structure of Ctx is largely unaffected by the presence of the graphitic surface and, consistently with previous literature studies, our simulations reveal that positively charged amino acidic residues, such as Lys and Arg, predominantly contribute to the stabilization of the CNTCtx complex acting like surfactants. The predicted structural models are consistent with the experimental data, for which the immobilization of the antibody on CNTs does not disrupt the structural and recognition properties of the Ctx, consequently supporting the reliability of the used bioconjugation strategy for engineering stable and responsive hybrid nanomaterials for therapeutic applications. Moreover, a remarkable structural similarity of Ctx with antibodies of different isotypes suggests that in principle the CNT framework can interact in the same manner with all antibodies currently used in clinical applications.","[De Leo, Federica; Bonifazi, Davide] Univ Namur UNamur, Dept Chem, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [De Leo, Federica; Bonifazi, Davide] Univ Namur UNamur, Namur Res Coll NARC, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Sgrignani, Jacopo; Magistrato, Alessandra] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA ISAS, CNR IOM Democritos Natl Simulat Ctr, I-34165 Trieste, Italy; [Bonifazi, Davide] Univ Trieste, Dept Pharmaceut & Chem Sci, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Bonifazi, Davide] Univ Trieste, INSTM UdR Trieste, I-34127 Trieste, Italy","Bonifazi, D (corresponding author), Univ Namur UNamur, Dept Chem, Rue Bruxelles 61, B-5000 Namur, Belgium.",davide.bonifazi@unamur.be; alessandra.magistrato@sissa.it,"De Leo, Federica/K-7107-2016; Bonifazi, Davide/B-2718-2016; Magistrato, Alessandra/U-9756-2019; Sgrignani, Jacopo/D-5747-2011","De Leo, Federica/0000-0001-8554-8507; Bonifazi, Davide/0000-0001-5717-0121; Sgrignani, Jacopo/0000-0002-8633-1032","EU through the ERC [PITN-GA-2008-215399]; FRS-FNRSFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [2.4.550.09, F.4.505.10.F]; Loterie Nationale; Science Policy Office of the Belgian Federal Government [BELSPO-IAP 7/05]; MIUR through the FIRB Futuro in Ricerca [RBFR10DAK6]; CASPUR HPC Grant on GPU cluster","D.B. gratefully acknowledges the EU through the ERC Starting Grant COLORLANDS and ITN FINELUMEN PITN-GA-2008-215399 projects, the FRS-FNRS (FRFC contracts no 2.4.550.09 and MIS no F.4.505.10.F), the Loterie Nationale, the Science Policy Office of the Belgian Federal Government (BELSPO-IAP 7/05 project), the MIUR through the FIRB Futuro in Ricerca (SUPRACARBON, contract no RBFR10DAK6).

Inspired by metadynamics, it uses several collective variables that are relevant for the investigated process and a bias potential that discourages the sampling of already visited configurations. The latter potential allows escaping a local free energy minimum following the direction of slow motions. This is different from metadynamics in which there is no specific direction of the biasing force and the computational effort increases significantly with the number of collective variables. The method is tested on the Ace-Ala(3)-Nme peptide, and then it is applied to investigate the Trp-cage folding mechanism. For this protein, within a few hundreds of nanoseconds, a broad range of conformations is explored, including nearly native ones, initiating the simulation from a completely unfolded conformation. Finally, several folding/unfolding trajectories give a systematic description of the Trp-cage folding pathways, leading to a unified view for the folding mechanisms of this protein. The proposed mechanism is consistent with NMR chemical shift data at increasing temperature and recent experimental observations pointing to a pivotal role of secondary structure elements in directing the folding process toward the native state.","Max Planck Inst Biophys, Theoret Mol Biophys Grp, Frankfurt, Germany","Marinelli, F (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Theoret Mol Biophys Grp, Frankfurt, Germany.",fabrizio.marinelli@gmail.com,"Marinelli, Fabrizio/I-7611-2019","Marinelli, Fabrizio/0000-0003-0044-6718",,,,73,13,13,1,46,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

With such knowledge, model predictions could be associated with quantitative estimates of their uncertainty. In addition, novel algorithms could be designed to proactively reduce prediction errors. We investigated how errors propagate in statistical mechanical ensembles and found that free energy evaluations based on single molecular configurations yield maximum uncertainties in free energy. Furthermore, increasing the size of the ensemble by sampling and averaging over additional independent configurations reduces uncertainties in free energy dramatically. This finding suggests a general strategy that could be utilized as a posthoc correction for improved precision in virtual screening and free energy estimation.","[Faver, John C.; Ucisik, Melek N.; Merz, Kenneth M., Jr.] Univ Florida, Dept Chem, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Faver, John C.; Ucisik, Melek N.; Merz, Kenneth M., Jr.] Univ Florida, Quantum Theory Project, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Yang, Wei] Florida State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Yang, Wei] Florida State Univ, Inst Mol Biophys, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Merz, KM (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Chem, 2328 New Phys Bldg,POB 118435, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",kmerz1@gmail.com,"Merz, Kenneth/A-2997-2019","Merz, Kenneth/0000-0001-9139-5893; Faver, John/0000-0002-0181-9283","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM044974, R01GM066859, R01GM044974, R01GM066859, R01GM066859, R01GM066859, R01GM066859, R01GM066859, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM066859, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM066859, R01GM066859, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM044974, R01GM066859, R01GM044974, R01GM066859] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM066859, R01 GM044974] Funding Source: Medline",,,14,7,7,0,24,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-5875,,,ACS MED CHEM LETT,ACS Med.

An in-depth understanding of the folding-function relationship is one of the most important subjects for biologists, and is of interest to scientific researchers in other disciplines. The folding of proteins is often completed within the order of milliseconds to seconds, whereas the underlying atomistic details corresponding to structural alterations and intermolecular interactions often occur on the nanosecond or even smaller timescales. Accordingly, the unambiguous description of complicated folding behaviors remains inaccessible to routine experimental and theoretically-calculated resolutions. In this paper, we review the problems that exist in recent experimental and theoretical studies examining the protein folding mechanism. The Trp-cage is a fast-folding mini-protein containing merely 20 amino acid residues, but adopts a well-packed hydrophobic core and tertiary contacts. Herein, we use the Trp-cage as an example and summarize the experimental and theoretical research carried out on the Trp-cage formation and its folding mechanism. The presentation primarily focuses on three aspects: (1) the folding temperature; (2) the folding initiation and proposed folding mechanisms; and (3) the role of key residues and its driving force for the folding of the Trp-cage mini-protein. Finally, we provide some suggestions on how to effectively simplify the complicated interaction networks of the Trp-cage mini-protein and decrease the complexity of the folding mechanism. This helps us to clarify the respective and cooperative contributions of residues involved in the formation of the Trp-cage and its folding dynamics, as well as provide useful insights for folding studies and more efficient rational peptide design.","[Wu Xiao-Min; Xue Shu-Lei; Zha Ling-Sheng; Wang Guang-Li; Zhang Hai-Jun] Huaibei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Resource & Plant Biol Anhui Prov, Huaibei 235000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wu Xiao-Min] Northeast Forestry Univ, Natl Local Joint Engn Lab Bioresource Ecol Utiliz, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Yuan Xiao-Hui] Jinan Univ, Inst Biomed, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Wu, XM (corresponding author), Huaibei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Resource & Plant Biol Anhui Prov, Huaibei 235000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",dolphin1009@sina.com; theobiochem@sina.cn,"Wu, Xiaomin/S-4953-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81272377, 31100083]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1208085QC58]; Natural Science Foundation from Educational Commission of Anhui Province, China [KJ2012B163, 2012SQRL225]; Talented Funds of Huaibei Normal University, China [600698]","The project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81272377, 31100083), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, China (1208085QC58), Natural Science Foundation from Educational Commission of Anhui Province, China (KJ2012B163, 2012SQRL225), and Talented Funds of Huaibei Normal University, China (600698).",,114,0,0,1,31,PEKING UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"PEKING UNIV, CHEMISTRY BUILDING, BEIJING 100871, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-6818,,,ACTA PHYS-CHIM SIN,Acta Phys.-Chim.

From the experimental studies, we make a conclusion that the left-handed three-helix proteins fold faster than the right-handed ones. What may explain this difference? An important question arising in this paper is whether the modeling of protein folding can catch the difference between the protein folding rates of proteins with similar structures but with different folding mechanisms. To answer this question, the folding of eight three-helix proteins (four right-handed and four left-handed), which are similar in size, was modeled using the Monte Carlo and dynamic programming methods. The studies allowed us to determine the orders of folding of the secondary-structure elements in these domains and amino acid residues which are important for the folding. The obtained data are in good correlation with each other and with the experimental data. Structural analysis of these proteins demonstrated that the left-handed domains have a lesser number of contacts per residue and a smaller radius of cross section than the right-handed domains. This may be one of the explanations of the observed fact. The same tendency is observed for the large dataset consisting of 332 three-helix proteins (238 right- and 94 left-handed). From our analysis, we found that the left-handed three-helix proteins have some less-dense packing that should result in faster folding for some proteins as compared to the case of right-handed proteins.Proteins 2013; (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","[Glyakina, Anna V.; Pereyaslavets, Leonid B.; Galzitskaya, Oxana V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Prot Res, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia; [Glyakina, Anna V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Math Problems Biol, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia","Galzitskaya, OV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Prot Res, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia.",ogalzit@vega.protres.ru,"GALZITSKAYA, OXANA V/L-2664-2015; Glyakina, Anna/O-2759-2013","Glyakina, Anna/0000-0002-6352-2880",Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [11-04-00763]; Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Academy of Sciences [01201353567],Grant sponsor: Russian Foundation for Basic Research; grant number: 11-04-00763; Grant sponsor: Russian Academy of Sciences (programs Molecular and Cell Biology; grant number: 01201353567 and Fundamental Sciences to Medicine).,,54,4,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-3585,1097-0134,,PROTEINS,Proteins,SEP,2013,81,9,,,,,1527,1541,,10.1002/prot.24301,,,15,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,204RT,WOS:000323386900004,23588993,,,,2020-11-19,

Employing adaptive hydrogen bond specific charge (AHBC) scheme to account for the polarization effect of hydrogen bonds established during the simulation, the effective folding of the three extended helices were observed with best backbone RMSDs in comparison to the experimental structures over the helical region determined to be 1.30 angstrom for 2khk, 0.73 angstrom for N36 and 0.72 angstrom for C34. In this study, 2khk will be used as a benchmark case serving as a means to compare the ability of polarized (AHBC) and nonpolarized force field in the folding of an extended helix. Analyses conducted revealed the ability of the AHBC scheme in effectively folding the extended helix by promoting helix growth through the stabilization of backbone hydrogen bonds upon formation during the folding process. Similar observations were also noted when AHBC scheme was employed during the folding of C34 and N36. However, under Amber03 force field, helical structures formed during the folding of 2khk was not accompanied by stabilization thus highlighting the importance of electrostatic polarization in the folding of helical structures.

Over the past decade, coarse-grained (CG) models that rely on a reduced representation of the polymer chain as dictated by the native structure have been quite successful in characterizing and predicting a variety of aspects of the folding mechanism of single-domain proteins. The ever-increasing ability of this minimalist treatment is a primarily due to the rapid and efficient sampling afforded by coarse-graining that smoothens the folding landscape and the simple nature of the constituent physical energy functions that can be easily cast in various forms or parameterized using experimental or knowledge-based approaches. With the advances in computational power we have now reached a stage where CG simulations can be routinely performed to test various mechanistic hypothesis, to interpret intricate experimental observables and even suggest new experimental avenues. Here, we provide an overview of recent CG developments that have predicted experiments quantitatively and others that have sought to use experimental information as constraints to tune the energetics and answer fundamental questions in folding and conformational behavior of proteins. We further discuss open issues and point to new directions that can drive the CG models toward better agreement with experiments and to a better understanding of folding mechanisms in general.

One of the obstacles to measuring fast kinetics in single molecule fluorescence experiments is blinking of the fluorophores on a timescale that is not well separated from the process of interest. By incorporating acceptor blinking into a two-state kinetics model, we show that it is possible to extract accurate rate coefficients on the microsecond time scale for folding and unfolding using the maximum likelihood method of Gopich and Szabo. This method yields the most likely parameters of a given model that can reproduce the observed photon trajectories. The extracted parameters agree with both the decay rate of the donor-acceptor cross correlation function and the results of ensemble equilibrium and kinetic experiments using nanosecond laser temperature jump.

The iAMOEBA model uses a direct approximation to describe electronic polarizability, in which the induced dipoles are determined directly from the permanent multipole electric fields and do not interact with one another. The direct approximation reduces the computational cost relative to a fully self-consistent polarizable model such as AMOEBA. The model is parameterized using ForceBalance, a systematic optimization method that simultaneously utilizes training data from experimental measurements and high-level ab initio calculations. We show that iAMOEBA is a highly accurate model for water in the solid, liquid, and gas phases, with the ability to fully capture the effects of electronic polarization and predict a comprehensive set of water properties beyond the training data set including the phase diagram. The increased accuracy of AMOEBA over the fully polarizable AMOEBA model demonstrates ForceBalance as a method that allows the researcher to systematically improve empirical models by efficiently utilizing the available data.","[Wang, Lee-Ping; Eastman, Peter K.; Martinez, Todd J.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Head-Gordon, Teresa] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Chem Bioengn Chem & Biomol Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ponder, Jay W.] Washington Univ, Dept Chem, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Ren, Pengyu] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Biomed Engn, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Chodera, John D.] Sloan Kettering Inst, Computat Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,"Ren, Pengyu/Q-6872-2017; Martinez, Todd J/F-4306-2010; Wang, Lee-Ping/P-8597-2016","Ren, Pengyu/0000-0002-5613-1910; Martinez, Todd J/0000-0002-4798-8947; Wang, Lee-Ping/0000-0003-3072-9946; Chodera, John/0000-0003-0542-119X","SimBios program; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54 GM072970]; Department of Defense (Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering) through the National Security Science and Engineering Fellowship programUnited States Department of Defense; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265731, CHE-1048789]; National Science Foundation Division of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF CHE-1152823]; Robert A.

Strikingly, seven water molecules are observed in more than 90% of the known structures. To gain insight into their possible function, the water dynamics inside Therms thermophilus beta-glycosidase was probed using deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy, allowing the pinpointing of peptide L117-A125, which exchanges most of its amide hydrogens quickly in spite of the fact that it is for the most part buried in the crystal structure. To help interpret this result, a molecular dynamics simulation was performed whose analysis suggests that two water channels are involved in the process. The longest one (similar to 16 angstrom) extends between the protein surface and W120, whose side chain interacts with E164 (the acid base residue involved in the catalytic mechanism), whereas the other channel allows for the exchange with the bulk of the highly conserved water molecules belonging to the hydration shell of D121, a deeply buried residue. Our simulation also shows that another chain of highly conserved water molecules, going from the protein surface to the bottom of the active site cleft close to the nucleophile residue involved in the catalytic mechanism, is able to exchange with the bulk on the nanosecond time scale. It is tempting to speculate that at least one of these three water channels could be involved in the function of family 1 glycoside hydrolases.","[Teze, David; Hendrickx, Johann; Dion, Michel; Tellier, Charles; Vinh Tran; Sanejouand, Yves-Henri] Univ Nantes, UFIP, F-44322 Nantes, France; [Woods, Virgil L., Jr.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Sanejouand, YH (corresponding author), Univ Nantes, UFIP, 2 Rue Houssiniere, F-44322 Nantes, France.",yves-henri.sanejouand@univ-nantes.fr,"teze, david/F-3217-2016","teze, david/0000-0002-6865-6108",Region Pays de la Loire through the GLYCONET networkRegion Pays de la Loire,A GENCI-CINES starting grant of computer time du directeur is acknowledged as well as financial support from Region Pays de la Loire through the GLYCONET network.,,49,23,23,2,23,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0006-2960,,,BIOCHEMISTRY-US,Biochemistry,AUG 27,2013,52,34,,,,,5900,5910,,10.1021/bi400260b,,,11,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,210EA,WOS:000323810900019,23895259,,,,2020-11-19,

A multiple minima Go-like potential energy function is used in combination with several enhancing sampling strategies, such as metadynamics, Maxwell Demon molecular dynamics and essential dynamics. The method, which shows an unprecedented computational efficiency, is able to trace a wide range of known experimental transitions. Contrary to simpler methods our strategy does not introduce distortions in the chemical structure of the protein and is able to reproduce well complex non-linear conformational transitions.

Here, we present reproducible folding of a 92 residue / protein (residues 3-94 of Top7, PDB ID: 1QYS) in computer simulations starting from random initial conformations using a transferable physical model which has been previously shown to describe the folding and thermodynamic properties of about 20 other smaller proteins of different folds. Top7 is a de novo designed protein with two -helices and a five stranded -sheet. Experimentally, it is known to be unusually stable for its size, and its folding transition distinctly deviates from the two-state behavior commonly seen in natural single domain proteins. In our all-atom implicit solvent parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, Top7 shows a rapid transition to a group of states with high native-like secondary structure, and a much slower subsequent transition to the native state with a root mean square deviation of about 3.5 angstrom from the experimentally determined structure. Consistent with experiments, we find Top7 to be thermally extremely stable, although the simulations also find a large number of very stable non-native states with high native-like secondary structure.

First, using action-derived molecular dynamics (ADMD), we investigate the dynamic folding pathway model of a protein between a fixed extended conformation and a compact conformation. We choose the pathway model to be the reaction coordinate, and the folding and unfolding processes are characterized by the ADMD step index, in contrast to the common a priori reaction coordinate as used in conventional studies. Second, we calculate free-energy profile as the function of temperature, by employing the replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method. The current method provides efficient exploration of conformational space and proper characterization of protein folding/unfolding dynamics from/to an arbitrary extended conformation. We demonstrate that combination of the two simulation methods, ADMD and REMD, provides understanding on molecular conformational changes in proteins. The protocol is tested on a small protein, penta-peptide of met-enkephalin. For the neuropeptide met-enkephalin system, folded, extended, and intermediate sates are well-defined through the free-energy profile over the reaction coordinate. Results are consistent with those in the literature.","[Lee, In-Ho] Korea Res Inst Stand & Sci, Taejon 305340, South Korea; [Kim, Seung-Yeon] Korea Natl Univ Transportat, Sch Liberal Arts & Sci, Chungju 380702, South Korea; [Lee, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Sci, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 130722, South Korea","Lee, J (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Sci, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",ihlee@kriss.re.kr; sykimm@ut.ac.kr; jlee@kias.re.kr,"Lee, In-Ho/C-6235-2011; Lee, In-Ho/AAG-5012-2020","Lee, In-Ho/0000-0002-1001-6159; Lee, In-Ho/0000-0002-1001-6159",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)National Research Foundation of Korea; Korea government (MSIP) [2008-0061987],This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. 2008-0061987).

Although several lines of evidence suggest that IT primarily represents visual shape information, some recent studies have argued that neuronal ensembles in IT code the semantic membership of visual objects (i.e., represent conceptual classes such as animate and inanimate objects). In this study, we investigated to what extent semantic, rather than purely visual information, is represented in IT by performing a multivariate analysis of IT responses to a set of visual objects. By relying on a variety of machine-learning approaches (including a cutting-edge clustering algorithm that has been recently developed in the domain of statistical physics), we found that, in most instances, IT representation of visual objects is accounted for by their similarity at the level of shape or, more surprisingly, low-level visual properties. Only in a few cases we observed IT representations of semantic classes that were not explainable by the visual similarity of their members. Overall, these findings reassert the primary function of IT as a conveyor of explicit visual shape information, and reveal that low-level visual properties are represented in IT to a greater extent than previously appreciated. In addition, our work demonstrates how combining a variety of state-of-the-art multivariate approaches, and carefully estimating the contribution of shape similarity to the representation of object categories, can substantially advance our understanding of neuronal coding of visual objects in cortex.","[Baldassi, Carlo; Zecchina, Riccardo] Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Turin, Italy; [Baldassi, Carlo; Zecchina, Riccardo] Politecn Torino, Ctr Computat Sci, Turin, Italy; [Baldassi, Carlo; Alemi-Neissi, Alireza; Zecchina, Riccardo] Human Genet Fdn HuGeF, Turin, Italy; [Alemi-Neissi, Alireza; Zoccolan, Davide] SISSA, Int Sch Adv Studies, I-34014 Trieste, Italy; [Pagan, Marino; DiCarlo, James J.; Zoccolan, Davide] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pagan, Marino; DiCarlo, James J.; Zoccolan, Davide] MIT, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pagan, Marino] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Baldassi, C (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Turin, Italy.",zoccolan@sissa.it,"Zoccolan, Davide/AAO-5571-2020; Baldassi, Carlo/I-2212-2017; Alemi, Alireza/AAM-1076-2020; Baldassi, Carlo/Q-4643-2019","Alemi, Alireza/0000-0002-5811-775X; Baldassi, Carlo/0000-0002-5451-8388; Zoccolan, Davide/0000-0001-7221-4188; ZECCHINA, Riccardo/0000-0002-1221-5207","National Institute of Mental Health Conte [NIH-P20-MH66239, NIH-R01-EY014970]; HFSP Long Term Postdoctoral Fellowship; Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei - Compagnia di San Paolo GrantCompagnia di San Paolo; Programma Neuroscienze Grant of the Compagnia di San Paolo; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [267915]; NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI) [R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970, R01EY014970] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [P20MH066239, P20MH066239, P20MH066239, P20MH066239, P20MH066239, P20MH066239, P20MH066239] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by The National Institute of Mental Health Conte, NIH-P20-MH66239 and NIH-R01-EY014970 (JJD), an HFSP Long Term Postdoctoral Fellowship (DZ), an Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei - Compagnia di San Paolo Grant (DZ), a Programma Neuroscienze Grant of the Compagnia di San Paolo (DZ and RZ), and ERC Grant 267915 (CB and RZ).

The treatment of permanent electrostatic dipoles of the backbone and polar side-chains allows to simulate proteins, preserving an excellent structural and dynamic agreement with respective reference structures and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, multiprotein complexes can be well described maintaining their molecular interfaces thanks to the ability of this scheme to better describe the actual electrostatics at a CG level of resolution. An efficient and robust heuristic algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is used for the derivation of CG parameters via a force-matching procedure. The ability of this protocol to deal with high dimensional search spaces suggests that the extension of this optimization procedure to larger data sets may lead to the generation of a fully transferable CG force field. At the present stage, these electrostatic-consistent CG potentials are easily and efficiently parametrized, show a good degree of transferability, and can be used to simulate soluble proteins or, more interestingly, large macromolecular assemblies for which long all-atom simulations may not be easily affordable.","[Spiga, Enrico; Alemani, Davide; Degiacomi, Matteo T.; Dal Peraro, Matteo] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Inst Bioengn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cascella, Michele] Univ Bern, Dept Chem & Biochem, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Dal Peraro, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Life Sci, Inst Bioengn, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",matteo.dalperaro@epfl.ch,"Cascella, Michele/Q-6097-2019; Degiacomi, Matteo/M-4342-2017; Cascella, Michele/K-3256-2012","Cascella, Michele/0000-0003-2266-5399; Degiacomi, Matteo/0000-0003-4672-471X; Cascella, Michele/0000-0003-2266-5399","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021_122120, 200020_138013, PP00P2_139195]","The authors thank Dr. Luciano Abriata for proofreading the manuscript and discussions; Dr. Marco Stenta and Dr. Francesca Collu for useful discussions; Thomas Lemmin and Christophe Bovigny for technical support.

The energy function consists of standard molecular dynamics energy terms plus a hydrogen-bonding potential term and is mainly parametrized based on the CHARMM22/CMAP force field in a bottom-up fashion. The solvent is treated implicitly via the generalized Born model. The bonded interactions are either harmonic or distance-based spline interpolated potentials. These potentials are defined on the basis of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of dipeptides with the CHARM/M22/CMAP force field. The nonbonded parameters are tuned by matching conformational free energies of diverse set of conformations with that of CHARMM all-atom results. PRIMO is designed to provide a correct description of conformational distribution of the backbone (phi/psi) and side chains (chi(1)) for all amino acids with a CMAP correction term. The CMAP potential in PRIMO is optimized based on the new CHARMM C36 CMAP. The resulting optimized force field has been applied in MD simulations of several proteins of 36-155 amino acids and shown that the root-mean-squared-deviation of the average structure from the corresponding crystallographic structure varies between 1.80 and 4.03 angstrom. PRIMO is shown to fold several small peptides to their native-like structures from extended conformations. These results suggest the applicability of the PRIMO force field in the study of protein structures in aqueous solution, structure predictions, as well as ab initio folding of small peptides.","[Kar, Parimal; Gopal, Srinivasa Murthy; Cheng, Yi-Ming; Predeus, Alexander; Feig, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Feig, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Chem, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Feig, M (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",feig@msu.edu,"Kar, Parimal/D-5874-2011; Predeus, Alexander V/S-1122-2016","Predeus, Alexander V/0000-0002-2750-1599; Kar, Parimal/0000-0001-8451-9739","National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM084953, GM092949]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM092949, R01GM084953, R01GM092949, R01GM092949, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM092949, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R01GM084953] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by National Institute of Health Grants GM084953 and GM092949.

However, these metrics do not provide any information on the causality relationships between residues. Such drive-response relationships are poorly studied in protein folding/function and difficult to measure experimentally due to technical limitations. In this study, using the information theory transfer entropy (TE) that provides a direct measurement of causality between two times series, we have quantified the drive-response relationships between residues in the folding/unfolding processes of four small proteins generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Instead of using a time-averaged single TE value, the time-dependent TE is measured with the Q-scores based on residue-residue contacts and with the statistical significance analysis along the folding/unfolding processes. The TE analysis is able to identify the driving and responding residues that are different from the highly correlated residues revealed by the mutual information analysis. In general, the driving residues have more regular secondary structures, are more buried, and show greater effects on the protein stability as well as folding and unfolding rates. In addition, the dominant driving and responding residues from the TE analysis on the whole trajectory agree with those on a single folding event, demonstrating that the drive-response relationships are preserved in the nonequilibrium process. Our study provides detailed insights into the protein folding process and has potential applications in protein engineering and interpretation of time-dependent residue-based experimental observables for protein function.","[Im, Wonpil] Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; Univ Kansas, Ctr Bioinformat, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA","Im, W (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Mol Biosci, 2030 Becker Dr, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA.",wonpil@ku.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U54GM087519]; TeraGrid XSEDE resources [TG-MCB070009]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We are grateful to Amitava Roy and Carol B.

While its scoring function can distinguish native-like from non-native-like conformations in many cases, the method is limited by conformational sampling for larger proteins, that is, leaving a local energy minimum in which the search algorithm may get stuck. Here, we test the hypothesis that iteration of Rosetta with an orthogonal sampling and scoring strategy might facilitate exploration of conformational space. Specifically, we run short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on models created by de novo folding of large proteins into cryoEM density maps to enable sampling of conformational space not directly accessible to Rosetta and thus provide an escape route from the conformational traps. We present a combined MD-Rosetta protein structure refinement protocol that can overcome some of these sampling limitations. Two of four benchmark proteins showed incremental improvement through all three rounds of the iterative refinement protocol. Molecular dynamics is most efficient in applying subtle but important rearrangements within secondary structure elements and is thus highly complementary to the Rosetta refinement, which focuses on side chains and loop regions.","[Lindert, Steffen; McCammon, J.

Biomolecular modelling techniques are becoming increasingly easier to use, whereas hardware and software are becoming better and cheaper. Cross-talk between theoretical and experimental scientists dealing with cancer-research from a molecular approach, however, is still uncommon. This is in contrast to other fields, such as amyloid-related diseases, where molecular modelling studies are widely acknowledged. The aim of this review paper is therefore to expose some of the more common approaches in molecular modelling to cancer scientists in simple terms, illustrating success stories while also revealing the limitations of computational studies at the molecular level.

Our model employs a natural coordinate system for describing proteins and a search strategy inspired by the observation that real proteins fold in a sequential fashion by incrementally stabilizing nativelike substructures or foldons.'' Comparable folding pathways and structures are obtained for the twelve proteins recently studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations [K. Lindorff-Larsen, S. Piana, R. O. Dror, D. E. Shaw, Science 334, 517 (2011)], with our calculations running several orders of magnitude faster. We find that nativelike propensities in the unfolded state do not necessarily determine the order of structure formation, a departure from a major conclusion of the molecular dynamics study. Instead, our results support a more expansive view wherein intrinsic local structural propensities may be enhanced or overridden in the folding process by environmental context. The success of our search strategy validates it as an expedient mechanism for folding both in silico and in vivo.","[Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Adhikari, Aashish N.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Freed, Karl F.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Freed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",trsosnic@uchicago.edu; freed@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM55694]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and EngineeringUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0008631]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the Freed/Sosnick groups, S.

In principle, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can investigate these issues, but with current computer facilities, these simulations have been limited to small RNAs and to short times. HiRe-RNA, a recently proposed high-resolution coarse-grained RNA that captures many geometric details such as base pairing and stacking, is able to fold RNA molecules to near-native structures in a short computational time. So far, it had been applied to simple hairpins, and here we present its application to duplexes of a couple dozen nucleotides and show how with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) we can easily predict the correct double helix from a completely random configuration and study, the dissociation curve. To show the versatility of our model, we present an application to a double stranded DNA Molecule as well. A reconstruction algorithm allows us to obtain full atom structures from the coarse-grained model. Through atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), we can compare the dynamics starting from a representative structure of a low temperature replica from the experimental structure, and show how the two are statistic-ally identical, highlighting the validity of a coarse-grained approach for structured RNAs and DNAs.","[Cragnolini, Tristan; Derreumaux, Philippe; Pasquali, Samuela] Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Lab Biochim Theor, UPR 9080,Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Pasquali, S (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, CNRS, Lab Biochim Theor, UPR 9080,Sorbonne Paris Cite, IBPC 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",samuela.pasquali@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019","pasquali, samuela/0000-0003-1487-0894; Cragnolini, Tristan/0000-0001-6917-7056",Ecole Doctorale B3MI; French government [ANR-11-LABEX-0011-01],"The authors wish to thank the Ecole Doctorale B3MI for the financial support of T.C. and the CASPUR computing facility in Rome, where all atomistic simulations have been performed.

Protein surface electrostatic interactions are not evolutionarily optimized for stability and are an attractive target for the rational redesign of proteins. We show that surface charge mutants can exert stabilizing effects in distinct and unanticipated ways, including ones that are not predicted by existing methods, even when only solvent-exposed sites are targeted. Individual mutation of three solvent-exposed lysines in the villin headpiece subdomain significantly stabilizes the protein, but the mechanism of stabilization is very different in each case. One mutation destabilizes native-state electrostatic interactions but has a larger destabilizing effect on the denatured state, a second removes the desolvation penalty paid by the charged residue, whereas the third introduces unanticipated native-state interactions but does not alter electrostatics. Our results show that even seemingly intuitive mutations can exert their effects through unforeseen and complex interactions.","[Xiao, Shifeng; Shan, Bing; Bi, Yuan; Green, David F.; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Patsalo, Vadim; Green, David F.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Appl Math, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Patsalo, Vadim; Green, David F.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",daniel.raleigh@stonybrook.edu,,"Patsalo, Vadim/0000-0001-6047-5858; raleigh, daniel/0000-0003-3248-7493","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0919860]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-086199]; Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-98CH10886]; State of New York; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM086199, R01GM086199, R01GM086199, R01GM086199, R01GM086199] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Dr. Jae-Hyun Cho for helpful discussion.

Most of the approaches to this task, including Markov models, master-equation models, and kinetic network models, start by discretizing the high-dimensional state space and then characterize relaxation processes in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a discrete transition matrix. The practical success of such an approach depends very much on the ability to finely discretize the slow order parameters. How can this task be achieved in a high-dimensional configuration space without relying on subjective guesses of the slow order parameters? In this paper, we use the variational principle of conformation dynamics to derive an optimal way of identifying the slow subspace of a large set of prior order parameters - either generic internal coordinates or a user-defined set of parameters. Using a variational formulation of conformational dynamics, it is shown that an existing method-the time-lagged independent component analysis-provides the optional solution to this problem. In addition, optimal indicators-order parameters indicating the progress of the slow transitions and thus may serve as reaction coordinates-are readily identified. We demonstrate that the slow subspace is well suited to construct accurate kinetic models of two sets of molecular dynamics simulations, the 6-residue fluorescent peptide MR121-GSGSW and the 30-residue intrinsically disordered peptide kinase inducible domain (KID). The identified optimal indicators reveal the structural changes associated with the slow processes of the molecular system under analysis.

This question is addressed by analyzing folding and nonfolding trajectories of a protein; as an example, the analysis is applied to the 37-residue triple beta-strand WW domain from the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP28) (PDB ID: 1E0L). Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories were generated with the coarse-grained united-residue force field, and one- and two-dimensional free-energy landscapes (FELs) along the backbone virtual-bond angle theta and backbone virtual-bond-dihedral angle gamma of each residue and principal components, respectively, were analyzed. The key residues involved in the folding of the FBP28 WW domain are elucidated by this analysis. The correlations between local and global motions are found. It is shown that most of the residues in the folding trajectories of the system studied here move in a concerted fashion, following the dynamics of the whole system. This demonstrates how the choice of a pathway has to involve concerted movements in order for this protein to fold. This finding also sheds light on the effectiveness of principal component analysis (PCA) for the description of the folding dynamics of the system studied. It is demonstrated that the FEL along the PCs, computed by considering only several critically-placed residues, can correctly describe the folding dynamics.","[Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France","Scheraga, HA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",has5@cornell.edu,,"Liwo, Adam/0000-0001-6942-2226","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB10-19767]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1019767] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1019767] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and the National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767) and conducted by using the resources of (a) our 588-processor Beowulf cluster at the Baker Laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, (b) the National Science Foundation Terascale Computing System at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, (c) the Beowulf cluster at the Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, (d) the Informatics Center of the Metropolitan Academic Network (IC MAN) in Gdansk, and (e) the Interdisciplinary Center of Mathematical and Computer Modeling (ICM) at the University of Warsaw.",,62,11,11,0,33,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

The parameters are determined by considering three level of approximations and characterizing the folding for three selected proteins (training set). Nine additional proteins (containing up to 126 residues) as well as mutated versions (test set) are folded with the given parameters. In all folding simulations, the initial state is a random coil configuration. Besides the native state, some proteins fold into an additional state differing in the topology (structure of the helical bundle).

Many peptidic and peptidomimetic drugs have reached the marketplace and opportunities for peptide-based drug discovery are on the rise. pH-dependent behavior of peptides is well documented in the context of misfolding diseases and peptide translocation. Changes in the protonation states of peptide residues often have a crucial effect on a peptide's structure, dynamics and function, which may be exploited for biotechnological applications. The current review surveys the increasing levels of sophistication in the treatment of protonation states in computational studies involving peptides. Specifically we describe I) the common practice of assigning a single protonation state and using it throughout the dynamic simulation, II) approaches that consider multiple protonation states and compare computed observables to experimental ones, III) constant pH molecular dynamics methods that couple changes in protonation states with conformational dynamics on the fly. Applications of conformational dynamics treatment of peptides in the context of binding, folding and interactions with the membrane are presented, illustrating the growing body of work in this field and highlighting the importance of careful handling of protonation states of peptidic residues.","[Ben-Shimon, Avraham; Niv, Masha Y.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Biochem Food Sci & Nutr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Ben-Shimon, Avraham; Niv, Masha Y.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fritz Haber Ctr Mol Dynam, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel; [Shalev, Deborah E.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Wolfson Ctr Appl Struct Biol, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel","Niv, MY (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Biochem Food Sci & Nutr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",niv@agri.huji.ac.il,"Niv, Masha/AAL-1123-2020","Niv, Masha/0000-0001-8275-8795",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [ME 1024/8]; Hebrew University,This work was funded by grant by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) ME 1024/8 and intramural grant from the Hebrew University to MYN.

The principal drawback of such approaches is the computational cost, which typically ranges from 3 to 10 times that of the equivalent additive model, and may be greater for more sophisticated treatments of polarization or other many-body effects. Here, we present a multiscale approach that may be used to enhance the sampling in simulations with polarizable models, by using the additive model as a tool to explore configuration space. We use a method based on information theory to determine the charges for an additive model that has optimal overlap with the polarizable one, and we demonstrate the feasibility of enhancing sampling via a hybrid replica exchange scheme for several model systems. An additional advantage is that, in the process, we obtain a systematic method for deriving charges for an additive model that will be the natural complement to its polarizable parent The additive charges are found by an effective coarse graining of the polarizable force field, rather than by ad hoc procedures.","[Baker, Christopher M.; Best, Robert B.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Best, Robert B.] Natl Inst Diabet & Digest & Kidney Dis, Lab Chem Phys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,"Baker, Christopher/G-4743-2012; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Baker, Christopher/A-5264-2010","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; ","FEBS Return to Europe Fellowship; Royal Society University Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","C.M.B. is supported by a FEBS Return to Europe Fellowship.

The conformation space is reduced in dimensionality by introduction of linear combinations of hydrogen bond distances as the collective variables making use of a specially adapted principal component analysis (PCA); i.e., to make structured conformations more pronounced, only the formed bonds are included in determining the principal components. It is shown that a three-dimensional (3D) subspace gives a meaningful representation of the folding behavior. The first component, to which eight native hydrogen bonds make the major contribution (four in each beta hairpin), is found to play the role of the reaction coordinate for the overall folding process, while the second and third components distinguish the structured conformations. The representative points of the trajectory in the 3D space are grouped into conformational clusters that correspond to locally stable conformations of beta3s identified in earlier work. A simplified kinetic network based on the three components is constructed, and it is complemented by a hydrodynamic analysis. The latter, making use of passive tracers in 3D space, indicates that the folding flow is much more complex than suggested by the kinetic network. A 2D representation of streamlines shows there are vortices which correspond to repeated local rearrangement, not only around minima of the free energy surface but also in flat regions between minima. The vortices revealed by the hydrodynamic analysis are apparently not evident in folding pathways generated by transition-path sampling. Making use of the fact that the values of the collective hydrogen bond variables are linearly related to the Cartesian coordinate space, the RMSD between clusters is determined. Interestingly, the transition rates show an approximate exponential correlation with distance in the hydrogen bond subspace. Comparison with the many published studies shows good agreement with the present analysis for the parts that can be compared, supporting the robust character of our understanding of this hydrogen atom of protein folding.","[Kalgin, Igor V.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Caflisch, Amedeo] Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Chekmarev, Sergei F.] SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Karplus, Martin] ISIS Univ Strasbourg, Lab Chim Biophys, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Karplus, Martin] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru; marci@tammy.harvard.edu,,,"U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation [RUB2-2913-NO-07]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804, R01GM030804] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We thank A.

In addition to a microsecond phase, we observe a slower 1.4-ms phase during refolding to the native state. Unlike temperature denaturation, pressure denaturation produces a highly reversible helix-coil-rich state. This difference highlights the importance of the denatured initial condition in folding experiments and leads us to assign a compact nonnative helical trap as the reason for slower P-jump-induced refolding. To complement the experiments, we performed over 50 mu s of all-atom molecular dynamics P-drop refolding simulations with four different force fields. Two of the force fields yield compact nonnative states with misplaced alpha-helix content within a few microseconds of the P-drop. Our overall conclusion from experiment and simulation is that the pressure-denatured state of lambda*YA contains mainly residual helix and little beta-sheet; following a fast P-drop, at least some lambda*YA forms misplaced helical structure within microseconds. We hypothesize that nonnative helix at helix-turn interfaces traps the protein in compact nonnative conformations. These traps delay the folding of at least some of the population for 1.4 ms en route to the native state. Based on molecular dynamics, we predict specific mutations at the helix-turn interfaces that should speed up refolding from the pressure-denatured state, if this hypothesis is correct.","[Prigozhin, Maxim B.; Wirth, Anna Jean; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Liu, Yanxin; Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Liu, Yanxin; Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Kapoor, Shobhna; Winter, Roland] Univ Dortmund, Dept Chem, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany","Gruebele, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, 1209 W Calif St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mgruebel@illinois.edu,"Liu, Yanxin/D-8633-2011","Liu, Yanxin/0000-0002-2253-3698; Winter, Roland/0000-0002-3512-6928","Texas Advanced Computing Center via the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment [MCA93S028]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RC2GM093307]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM093318, 9P41-GM104601]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY 0822613]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation (RESOLV) [EXC 1069]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1144245]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, RC2GM093307, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, RC2GM093307, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The Anton machine was generously donated by David E.

Here, we describe an effort to identify small peptides that can still form stable structures in aqueous solutions. We followed the in silico folding of a selected set of 8640 tryptophan-containing tetra- and pentapeptides through 15 210 molecular dynamics simulations amounting to a total of 272.46 mu s using explicit representation of the solute and full treatment of the electrostatics. The evaluation and sorting of peptides is achieved through scoring functions, which include terms based on interatomic vector distances, atomic fluctuations, and rmsd matrices between successive frames of a trajectory. Highly scored peptides are studied further via successive simulation rounds of increasing simulation length and using different empirical force fields. Our method suggested only a handful of peptides with strong foldability prognosis. The discrepancies between the predictions of the various force fields for such short sequences are also extensively discussed. We conclude that the vast majority of such short peptides do not adopt significantly stable structures in water solutions, at least based on our computational predictions.

Using long, all-atom simulations enabled by special-purpose hardware, we studied K+ permeation across the K(V)1.2/2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel. At experimentally accessible voltages, which include the physiological range, the simulated permeation rate was substantially lower than the experimentally observed rate. The current-voltage relationship was also nonlinear but became linear at much higher voltages. We observed permeation consistent with a knock-on mechanism at all voltages. At high voltages, the permeation rate was in accordance with our previously reported K(V)1.2 pore-only simulations, after the simulated voltages from the previous study were recalculated using the correct method, new insight into which is provided here. Including the voltage-sensing domains in the simulated channel brought the linear current-voltage regime closer to the experimentally accessible voltages. The simulated permeation rate, however, still underestimated the experimental rate, because formation of the knock-on intermediate occurred too infrequently. Reducing the interaction strength between the ion and the selectivity filter did not increase conductance. In complementary simulations of gramicidin A, similar changes in interaction strength did increase the observed permeation rate. Permeation nevertheless remained substantially below the experimental value, largely because of infrequent ion recruitment into the pore lumen. Despite the need to apply large voltages to simulate the permeation process, the apparent voltage insensitivity of the permeation mechanism suggests that the direct simulation of permeation at the single-ion level can provide fundamental physiological insight into ion channel function. Notably, our simulations suggest that the knock-on permeation mechanisms in K(V)1.2 and KcsA may be different.","[Jensen, Morten O.; Jogini, Vishwanath; Eastwood, Michael P.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Jensen, MO (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Morten.Jensen@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,,,,56,64,65,0,28,ROCKEFELLER UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"950 THIRD AVE, 2ND FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10022 USA",0022-1295,1540-7748,,J GEN PHYSIOL,J.

Riboswitches include an aptamer domain to detect the ligand and an expression platform to control gene expression. Previous structural studies of riboswitches largely focused on aptamers, truncating the expression domain to suppress conformational switching. To link ligand/aptamer binding to conformational switching, we constructed models of an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-I riboswitch RNA segment incorporating elements of the expression platform, allowing formation of an antiterminator (AT) helix. Using Anton, a computer specially developed for long timescale Molecular Dynamics (MD), we simulated an extended (three microseconds) MD trajectory with SAM bound to a modeled riboswitch RNA segment. Remarkably, we observed a strand migration, converting three base pairs from an antiterminator (AT) helix, characteristic of the transcription ON state, to a P1 helix, characteristic of the OFF state. This conformational switching towards the OFF state is observed only in the presence of SAM. Among seven extended trajectories with three starting structures, the presence of SAM enhances the trend towards the OFF state for two out of three starting structures tested. Our simulation provides a visual demonstration of how a small molecule (<500 MW) binding to a limited surface can trigger a large scale conformational rearrangement in a 40 kDa RNA by perturbing the Free Energy Landscape. Such a mechanism can explain minimal requirements for SAM binding and transcription termination for SAM-I riboswitches previously reported experimentally.","[Huang, Wei; Aboul-ela, Fareed] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Huang, Wei; Kim, Joohyun; Jha, Shantenu] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Computat & Technol, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Jha, Shantenu] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA","Huang, W (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Ctr Prote & Bioinformat, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",faboulela@zewailcity.edu.eg,"Huang, Wei/O-2035-2016","Huang, Wei/0000-0003-2097-8148","NIH National Center For Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P20RR016456]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [TG-MCB090174]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RC2GM093307]; LSU department of Biological Sciences; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456, P20RR016456] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [RC2GM093307, RC2GM093307] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Computing resources used for this work were made possible via NSF TRAC award TG-MCB090174 and LONI resources.

Biased or enhanced sampling methods may improve the convergence of expectation values of equilibrium probabilities and expectation values of stationary quantities significantly. Unfortunately the convergence of dynamic observables such as correlation functions or timescales of conformational transitions relies on direct equilibrium simulations. Markov state models are well suited to describe both stationary properties and properties of slow dynamical processes of a molecular system, in terms of a transition matrix for a jump process on a suitable discretization of continuous conformation space. Here, we introduce statistical estimation methods that allow a priori knowledge of equilibrium probabilities to be incorporated into the estimation of dynamical observables. Both maximum likelihood methods and an improved Monte Carlo sampling method for reversible transition matrices with fixed stationary distribution are given. The sampling approach is applied to a toy example as well as to simulations of the MR121-GSGS-W peptide, and is demonstrated to converge much more rapidly than a previous approach of Noe [J. Chem.

PUIS have been detected in several experimental and simulation studies. However, complete analyses of transitions between different PUIS and the unfolding trajectory are sparse. To understand such dynamical processes, we study chemical unfolding of a small protein, chicken villin head piece (HP-36), in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. We carry out molecular dynamics simulations at various solution compositions under ambient conditions. In each concentration, the initial step of unfolding involves separation of two adjacent native contacts, between phenyl alanine residues (11-18 and 7-18). This first step induces, under appropriate conditions, subsequent separation among other hydrophobic contacts, signifying a high degree of cooperativity in the unfolding process. The observed sequence of structural changes in HP-36 on increasing DMSO concentration and the observed sequence of PUIS, are in approximate agreement with earlier simulation results (in pure water) and experimental observations on unfolding of HP-36. Peculiar to water-DMSO mixture, an intervening structural transformation (around 15% of DMSO) in the binary mixture solvent retards the progression of unfolding as composition is increased. This is reflected in a remarkable nonmonotonic composition dependence of RMSD, radius of gyration and the fraction of native contacts. At 30% mole fraction of DMSO, we find the extended randomly coiled structure of the unfolded protein. The molecular mechanism of DMSO induced unfolding process is attributed to the initial preferential solvation of the hydrophobic side chain atoms through the methyl groups of DMSO, followed by the hydrogen bonding of the oxygen atom of DMSO to the exposed backbone NH groups of HP-36.","[Roy, Susmita; Bagchi, Biman] Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Bagchi, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Solid State & Struct Chem Unit, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",bbagchi@sscu.iisc.ernet.in,,"BAGCHI, BIMAN/0000-0002-7146-5994","DSTDepartment of Science & Technology (India); BRNS, IndiaDepartment of Atomic Energy (DAE)Board of Research in Nuclear Sciences (BRNS); Sir J.

The determination of the free-energy landscapes of proteins by computational methods is, however, very challenging as it requires an extensive sampling of their conformational spaces. We describe here a technique to achieve this goal with relatively limited computational resources by incorporating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts as collective variables in metadynamics simulations. As in this approach the chemical shifts are not used as structural restraints, the resulting free-energy landscapes correspond to the force fields used in the simulations. We illustrate this approach in the case of the third Ig-binding domain of protein G from streptococcal bacteria (GB3). Our calculations reveal the existence of a folding intermediate of GB3 with nonnative structural elements. Furthermore, the availability of the free-energy landscape enables the folding mechanism of GB3 to be elucidated by analyzing the conformational ensembles corresponding to the native, intermediate, and unfolded states, as well as the transition states between them. Taken together, these results show that, by incorporating experimental data as collective variables in metadynamics simulations, it is possible to enhance the sampling efficiency by two or more orders of magnitude with respect to standard molecular dynamics simulations, and thus to estimate free-energy differences among the different states of a protein with a k(B)T accuracy by generating trajectories of just a few microseconds.","[Granata, Daniele; Laio, Alessandro] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Camilloni, Carlo; Vendruscolo, Michele] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Vendruscolo, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",mv245@cam.ac.uk; laio@sissa.it,"Vendruscolo, Michele/F-5901-2012; Laio, Alessandro/K-2117-2012; Camilloni, Carlo/A-4395-2009","Vendruscolo, Michele/0000-0002-3616-1610; Laio, Alessandro/0000-0001-9164-7907; Camilloni, Carlo/0000-0002-9923-8590",Standard High Performance Computing (HPC) Grant from CASPUR Supercomputing Center for computational resources; Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro 5 per Mille GrantAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [Rif.12214]; Marie Curie Intra-European FellowshipEuropean Union (EU),We acknowledge Standard High Performance Computing (HPC) Grant 2011 from CASPUR Supercomputing Center for computational resources and Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro 5 per Mille Grant Rif.12214.

Structural and mechanical properties of such capsids, as well as their self-assembly process, have been studied experimentally and theoretically, including modeling efforts by computer simulations on various scales. Atomistic models include specific details of local protein binding but are limited in system size and accessible time, while coarse grained (CG) models do get access to longer time and length scales but often lack the specific local interactions. Multi-scale models aim at bridging this gap by systematically connecting different levels of resolution. Here, a CG model for CCMV (Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus), a virus with an icosahedral shell of 180 identical protein monomers, is developed, where parameters are derived from atomistic simulations of capsid protein dimers in aqueous solution. In particular, a new method is introduced to combine the MARTINI CG model with a supportive elastic network based on structural fluctuations of individual monomers. In the parametrization process, both network connectivity and strength are optimized. This elastic-network optimized CG model, which solely relies on atomistic data of small units (dimers), is able to correctly predict inter-protein conformational flexibility and properties of larger capsid fragments of 20 and more subunits. Furthermore, it is shown that this CG model reproduces experimental (Atomic Force Microscopy) indentation measurements of the entire viral capsid. Thus it is shown that one obvious goal for hierarchical modeling, namely predicting mechanical properties of larger protein complexes from models that are carefully parametrized on elastic properties of smaller units, is achievable.","[Globisch, Christoph; Peter, Christine] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res MPIP, Mainz, Germany; [Krishnamani, Venkatramanan; Deserno, Markus] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Phys, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Peter, C (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Polymer Res MPIP, Mainz, Germany.",peter@mpip-mainz.mpg.de,"Krishnamani, Venkatramanan/J-7535-2016; Deserno, Markus/P-1699-2014","Deserno, Markus/0000-0001-5692-1595",Volkwagen Foundation within the framework of the program New Conceptual Approaches to Modeling and Simulation of Complex Systems; German Science Foundation within the Emmy Noether Program,"The authors are grateful to the Volkwagen Foundation for supporting their project within the framework of the program New Conceptual Approaches to Modeling and Simulation of Complex Systems (www.volkswagenstiftung.de).

Here, we seek to address this by searching for evidence of evolutionary selection for ordered protein complex assembly. First, we experimentally characterize the assembly pathways of several heteromeric complexes and show that they can be simply predicted from their three-dimensional structures. Then, by mapping gene fusion events identified from fully sequenced genomes onto protein complex assembly pathways, we demonstrate evolutionary selection for conservation of assembly order. Furthermore, using structural and high-throughput interaction data, we show that fusion tends to optimize assembly by simplifying protein complex topologies. Finally, we observe protein structural constraints on the gene order of fusion that impact the potential for fusion to affect assembly. Together, these results reveal the intimate relationships among protein assembly, quaternary structure, and evolution and demonstrate on a genome-wide scale the biological importance of ordered assembly pathways.","[Marsh, Joseph A.; Teichmann, Sarah A.] EMBL European Bioinformat Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SD, England; [Hernandez, Helena; Hall, Zoe; Robinson, Carol V.] Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England; [Ahnert, Sebastian E.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Perica, Tina] MRC Lab Mol Biol, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England; [Teichmann, Sarah A.] Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst, Cambridge CB10 1SA, England","Robinson, CV (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Chem, Phys & Theoret Chem Lab, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QZ, England.",carol.robinson@chem.ox.ac.uk; sarah.teichmann@ebi.ac.uk,,"robinson, carol/0000-0001-7829-5505; Teichmann, Sarah/0000-0002-6294-6366; Perica, Tina/0000-0003-3152-8425; Marsh, Joseph/0000-0003-4132-0628; Hall, Zoe/0000-0002-1434-8329","Medical Research Council (MRC)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [U105161047]; Human Frontier Science Program OrganizationHuman Frontier Science Program; MRC Programme GrantMedical Research Council UK (MRC); Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London; ERC Advanced Grant; Royal Society Professorship; Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_U105161047, G1000819] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank I.

The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging' from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.","[Piana, Stefano; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Piana, S (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039",,,,94,204,205,1,158,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

The energy ranking of the native state and Z-scores were used to assess the performance of the models. The effect of membrane thickness was examined and was found to be substantial. Quite satisfactory discrimination was achieved with the all-atom IMM1 and GBSW models at 25.4 angstrom thickness and with the HDGB model at 28.5 angstrom thickness. The energy components by themselves were not discriminative. Both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions contributed to native state discrimination, to a different extent in each model. Computational efficiency of the models decreased in the order: extended-atom IMM1 > all-atom IMM1 > GBSAIM > GBSW > HDGB. These results encourage the further development and use of implicit membrane models for membrane protein structure prediction.

Clustering algorithms play an important role in understanding biomolecular kinetics from the simulation data, especially under the Markov state model framework. However, the ruggedness of the free energy landscape in a biomolecular system makes common clustering algorithms very sensitive to perturbations of the data. Here, we introduce a data-exploratory tool which provides an overview of the clustering structure under different parameters. The proposed Multi-Persistent Clustering analysis combines insights from recent studies on the dynamics of systems with dominant metastable states with the concept of multi-dimensional persistence in computational topology. We propose to explore the clustering structure of the data based on its persistence on scale and density. The analysis provides a systematic way to discover clusters that are robust to perturbations of the data. The dominant states of the system can be chosen with confidence. For the clusters on the borderline, the user can choose to do more simulation or make a decision based on their structural characteristics. Furthermore, our multi-resolution analysis gives users information about the relative potential of the clusters and their hierarchical relationship. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated in three biomolecules: alanine dipeptide, Villin headpiece, and the FiP35 WW domain.","[Chang, Huang-Wei] Stanford Univ, Inst Computat & Math Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bacallado, Sergio] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Carlsson, Gunnar E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Math, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Chang, HW (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Inst Computat & Math Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",huangwei@stanford.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-0900700]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) via NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM062868]; Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) [FA9550-09-0-1-0531, FA9550-09-1-0643]; NSF DMSNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0905823]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-08-1-0931]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant DMS-0900700.

Improvements in the generalized Born model and hydrophobicity term yield significantly more accurate energetics; specialized sampling algorithms allow complex local structures, such as a loop-helix-loop region, to be reliably predicted. A novel penalty term is added for loops containing patterns of dihedrals seldom found in experimental structures. We show prediction of diverse sets of large loops, in the native backbone environment, to subangstrom accuracy. The methodology offers the promise of addressing the refinement problem in homology modeling if an approach can be devised to handle delocalized errors in the structure.","[Friesner, Richard A.; Goldfeld, Dahlia A.; Miller, Edward B.; Murrett, Colleen S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Abel, Robert] Schrodinger Inc, New York, NY USA","Friesner, RA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rich@chem.columbia.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-40526]; Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Graduate Fellowship Program (DOE SCGF)United States Department of Energy (DOE); DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-06OR23100]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-07-07425]; NIH Training Program in Molecular Biophysics [T32GM008281]; Schrodinger, Inc.; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, R01GM040526, T32GM008281, T32GM008281, T32GM008281] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant to RAF under Grant No. GM-40526.

Defining the structural properties of the involved transient species is therefore of prime interest. Using a combination of cold denaturation with NMR spectroscopy, we reveal detailed insight into the unfolding of the homodimeric repressor protein CylR2. Seven three-dimensional structures of CylR2 at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 16 degrees C reveal a progressive dissociation of the dimeric protein into a native-like monomeric intermediate followed by transition into a highly dynamic, partially folded state. The core of the partially folded state seems critical for biological function and misfolding.","[Jaremko, Mariusz; Jaremko, Lukasz; Kim, Hai-Young; Cho, Min-Kyu; Giller, Karin; Becker, Stefan; Zweckstetter, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Jaremko, Mariusz] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Biochem & Biophys, Warsaw, Poland; [Jaremko, Lukasz] Warsaw Univ, Fac Chem, Warsaw, Poland; [Schwieters, Charles D.] US Natl Inst Hlth, Div Computat Biosci, Ctr Informat Technol, Bethesda, MD USA; [Zweckstetter, Markus] German Ctr Neurodegenerat Dis DZNE, Gottingen, Germany","Zweckstetter, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biophys Chem, Dept NMR Based Struct Biol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",Markus.Zweckstetter@dzne.de,"Cho, Min-Kyu/H-1303-2011; b, a/A-3101-2009","Cho, Min-Kyu/0000-0003-0537-2340; Zweckstetter, Markus/0000-0002-2536-6581; Jaremko, Mariusz/0000-0002-0787-702X","STARTAustrian Science Fund (FWF); Ventures Programmes of Foundation for Polish Science (Fundacja narzecz Nauki Polskiej); Polish Ministry of Sciences and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland; Cluster of Excellence and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Research Center; Center for Information Technology at the US National Institutes of Health; CENTER FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) [ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090, ZIACT000090] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank N.

At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources. Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.","[Pronk, Sander; Pall, Szilard; Bjelkmar, Par; Apostolov, Rossen; van der Spoel, David; Hess, Berk; Lindahl, Erik] Sci Life Lab, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden; [Pronk, Sander; Pall, Szilard; Apostolov, Rossen; Hess, Berk; Lindahl, Erik] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Theoret Phys, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Schulz, Roland; Smith, Jeremy C.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, UT ORNL Ctr Mol Biophys, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Schulz, Roland; Smith, Jeremy C.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Biochem & Cellular & Mol Biol, Knoxville, TN USA; [Larsson, Per; Kasson, Peter M.] Univ Virginia, Dept Mol Physiol & Biol Phys, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Larsson, Per; Kasson, Peter M.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Bjelkmar, Par; Lindahl, Erik] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Ctr Biomembrane Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Shirts, Michael R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Chem Engn, Charlottesville, VA USA; [van der Spoel, David] Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Uppsala, Sweden","Lindahl, E (corresponding author), Sci Life Lab, S-17121 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.lindahl@scilifelab.se,"smith, jeremy c/B-7287-2012; Schulz, Roland/A-1868-2010; Pall, Szilard/AAS-5910-2020; van der Spoel, David/AAD-9820-2019; Bjelkmar, Par/K-1402-2019; van der Spoel, David/A-5471-2008; Lindahl, Erik/D-4590-2013","smith, jeremy c/0000-0002-2978-3227; Schulz, Roland/0000-0003-1603-2413; Pall, Szilard/0000-0003-0603-5514; van der Spoel, David/0000-0002-7659-8526; Bjelkmar, Par/0000-0002-5560-865X; van der Spoel, David/0000-0002-7659-8526; Lindahl, Erik/0000-0002-2734-2794; Kasson, Peter/0000-0002-3111-8103","European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [209825, 258980]; Swedish research councilSwedish Research Council; Foundation for Strategic Research; Swedish e-Science Research Center; eSSENCE; National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM098304]; ScalaLife project; CRESTA EU FP7 project; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM098304, R01GM098304, R01GM098304, R01GM098304, R01GM098304, R01GM098304, R01GM098304] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","European Research Council [209825 to E.L., 258980 to B.H.]; Swedish research council (to E.L., D.V.D.S.); Foundation for Strategic Research (to E.L.); Swedish e-Science Research Center (to E.L., B.H.); eSSENCE (to D.V.D.S.); National Institute of Health [R01GM098304 to P.K.]; ScalaLife & CRESTA EU FP7 projects (to E.L., B.H.).

These models can provide a human-comprehensible picture of the underlying process and have been successfully used to study protein folding, protein aggregation, protein ligand binding, and other biophysical systems. The MSM requires the construction of a discrete state-space such that two points are in the same state if they can interconvert rapidly. In the following, we suggest an improved method, which utilizes second order Independent Component Analysis (also known as time-structure based Independent Component Analysis, or tICA), to construct the state space We apply this method to simulations of NTL9 (provided by Lindorff-Larsen et al. Science 2011, 334, 517-520) and show that the MSM is an improvement over previously built models using conventional distance metrics. Additionally, the resulting model provides insight into the role of non-native contacts by revealing many slow time scales associated with compact, non-native states.","[Schwantes, Christian R.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Biophys Program, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NIH R01-GM062868, NSF-MCB-0954714]; MRI-R2: Acquisition of a Hybrid CPU/GPU and Visualization Cluster for Multidisciplinary Studies in Transport Physics with Uncertainty Quantification; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM062868, R01GM101935, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM101935, R01GM101935, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM101935, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We would like to thank Kyle A.

Using recently developed tools to quantify mediation probabilities (hub scores), we quantify hub-like behavior in atomic resolution trajectories for the first time. We use a data set of trajectory ensembles for 12 fast-folding proteins previously published by D. E. Shaw Research (Lindorff-Larsen, K.; et al. How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold. Science 2011, 334, 517) with an aggregate simulation time of over 8.2 ms. We visualize the free-energy landscape of each molecule using configuration space networks, and show that dynamic quantities can be qualitatively understood from visual inspection of the networks. Modularity optimization is used to provide a parameter-free means of tessellating the network into a group of communities. Using hub scores, we find that the percentage of trajectories that are mediated by the native state is 31% when averaged over all molecules, and reaches a maximum of 52% for the homeodomain and chignolin. Furthermore, for these mediated transitions, we use Markov models to determine whether the native state acts as a facilitator for the transition, or as a trap (i.e., an off-pathway detour). Although instances of facilitation are found in 4 of the 12 molecules, we conclude that the native state acts primarily as a trap, which is consistent with the idea of a funnel-like landscape.","[Dickson, Alex; Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Brooks, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",brookscl@umich.edu,,"Dickson, Alex/0000-0002-9640-1380","Center for Multi-Scale modeling tools for structural biology (MMTSB); NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RR012255]; Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY0216576]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255, P41RR012255] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We are grateful to D.

The method proceeds by separating phase space into basins and transition regions between the basins based on a general collective variable (CV) criterion. The transition regions are treated via traditional molecular dynamics (MD) while Monte Carlo (MC) methods are used to (i) estimate the expected time spent in each basin and (ii) thermalize the system between two MD episodes. In particular, an efficient adiabatic switching based scheme is used to estimate the time spent inside the basins. The method offers various advantages over existing approaches in terms of (i) providing an accurate real time scale, (ii) avoiding reliance on harmonic transition state theory, and (iii) avoiding the need to enumerate all possible transition events. Applications of SISYPHUS to low-temperature vacancy diffusion in bcc Ta and adatom island ripening in fcc Al are presented. A CV appropriate for such condensed phases, especially for transitions involving collective motions of several atoms, is also introduced.

Here we present a detailed simulation study of Wimley-White (WW) peptides in bulk water to investigate sampling, conformations, and differences due to the different X residue with an eye to future simulations at the lipid/water interface where sampling problems so far have hindered free energy calculations to reproduce the experimental thermodynamic data. We investigate the conformational preferences and slowest relaxation time of WW peptides in bulk water by building Markov State Models (MSM) from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation data. We show that clustering based on binning of backbone phi, psi dihedrals in combination with the community detection algorithm of Blondel et al. provides a quick way of building MSM from large data sets. Our results show that in some cases, implied times even in these small peptides range from 224 to 547 ns. The implications of these slow transitions on determining the potential of mean force profiles of peptide interactions with a lipid bilayer are discussed.","[Tieleman, D.

They are becoming important targets for pharmaceutical applications. Due to RNA flexibility and to the strength of electrostatic interactions, standard docking methods are insufficient. We here present a computational method which allows studying the binding of RNA molecules and charged peptides with atomistic, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. In our method, a suitable estimate of the electrostatic interaction is used as an order parameter (collective variable) which is then accelerated using bidirectional pulling simulations. Since the electrostatic interaction is only used to enhance the sampling, the approximations used to compute it do not affect the final accuracy.

However, with an experimental folding time of similar to 6 mu s, it remains a challenging system for all-atom, explicitly solvated, molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we use a large simulation data set (0.7 ms total) of the hairpin at 300 and 350 K to interpret its folding via a master equation approach. We find a separation of over an order of magnitude between the longest and second longest relaxation times, with the slowest relaxation corresponding to folding. However, in spite of this apparent two-state dynamics, the folding rate determined based on a first-passage time analysis depends on the initial conditions chosen, with a nonexponential distribution of first passage times being obtained in some cases. Using the master equation model, we are now able to account quantitatively for the observed distribution of first passage times. The deviation from the expected exponential distribution for a two-state system arises from slow dynamics in the unfolded state, associated with formation and melting of helical structures. Our results help to reconcile recent findings of slow dynamics in unfolded proteins with observed two-state folding kinetics. At the same time, they indicate that care is required in estimating folding kinetics from many short folding simulations. Last, we are able to use the master equation model to obtain details of the folding mechanism and folding transition state, which appear consistent with the zipper mechanism inferred from the experiment.","[De Sancho, David] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Mittal, Jeetain] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Best, Robert B.] NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDKD, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bldg 2, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; De Sancho, David/C-4995-2009","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; De Sancho, David/0000-0002-8985-2685",FEBS Long Term Post Doctoral Fellowship; Royal Society University Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-120014],"D.D.S was supported by a FEBS Long Term Post Doctoral Fellowship and R.B.B. by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship.

The simulation was performed for acetaminophen crystal Form I dissolving in 0.15 M aqueous NaCl solution at 37 C. The 10 ns simulation revealed interesting details of the dissolution process. Dissolution of the molecules from the crystal surface is far from a random process. On the contrary, the order in which molecules enter the solution depends on their initial positions in or on the crystal. Molecules located on the corners and edges dissolved first followed by those located on {100}, {010}, and {001) surfaces with slight variation. This corner and edge effect that has been observed in our real dissolution experiment conducted under polarized light microscope was successfully predicted at molecular scale by the MD simulation. Further analyses identified the underlying mechanism: the differences in the molecular interaction energetics between the drug and water molecules. The molecules located on corners and edges of the parallelepiped crystal are not as tightly bound to their surrounding neighbors as those located in other positions, but they are more strongly interacting with the surrounding water molecules. The extent of molecular release is strongly correlated with the interplay between interaction forces with solvent molecules and with other drug molecules in the crystal lattice. These findings, especially the significant corner and edge effect, will help us gain additional fundamental understanding in the relationship between dissolution rate and particle size and morphology and, thus, are very relevant in the context of particle size reduction in delivering poorly water-soluble compounds. This study has also demonstrated that MD simulation is a powerful tool in studying dissolution phenomena.","[Gao, Yi; Olsen, Kenneth W.] Loyola Univ, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60660 USA; [Gao, Yi] AbbVie Inc, Pharmaceut Res & Dev, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA","Olsen, KW (corresponding author), Loyola Univ, Dept Chem, 1032 W Sheridan Rd, Chicago, IL 60660 USA.",gao.yi@abbvie.com; kolsen@luc.edu,,,Abbott's Tuition Assistance Program,"The authors express their sincere gratitude to Drs.

Arguably enough, structural biology and biophysics represent one of the greatest challenges for molecular dynamics, owing to the size of the biological.objects of interest and the time scales spanned by the molecular processes of the cell machinery in which these objects are prominent actors. The reader is assumed to be fully familiarized with the basic theoretical underpinnings of molecular-dynamics simulations, which will be discussed here from a biological standpoint, emphasizing how the enterprise of modeling increasingly larger molecular assemblies over physiologically relevant times has shaped the field. This review article will further show how the unbridled race to dilate both the spatial and the temporal scales, in an effort to bridge the gap between the latter, has greatly benefitted from groundbreaking advances on the hardware, computational front-notably through the development of massively parallel and dedicated architectures, as well as on the methodological, algorithmic front. The current trends in this research field, boosted by recent, cutting-edge achievements, wherein molecular dynamics has reached new frontiers, provide the basis for an introspective reflection and a prospective outlook into the future of biologically-oriented, high-performance numerical simulations. Furthermore, alternatives to brute-force molecular dynamics towards connecting time and size scales will be discussed, in particular a class of approaches relying upon the preferential sampling of judiciously chosen, important degrees of freedom of the biological object at hand. These methods, targeted primarily at providing a detailed thermodynamic picture of the molecular process at hand, can be viewed as computational tweezers designed to dissect the latter by means of a reduced set of collective variables.","[Cai Wensheng] Nankai Univ, Coll Chem, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Engn, Theoret & Computat Biophys Grp, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Lorraine, Equipe Dynam Assemblages Membranaires, UMR 7565, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Cai, WS (corresponding author), Nankai Univ, Coll Chem, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",wscai@nankai.edu.cn; chipot@ks.uiuc.edu,,,,,,113,6,7,1,71,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0567-7351,,,ACTA CHIM SINICA,Acta Chim.

The current bottlenecks in determining the protein structures require a new strategy using the simple design of an experiment, and SAXS is suitable for this purpose in spite of its low information content. First we demonstrated that SAXS constraints work additively to NMR-derived information in calculating structures. Next, structure calculations for nine proteins taking different folds were performed using the SAXS constraints combined with the NMR-derived distance restraints for local geometry such as secondary structures or those for tertiary structure. The results show that the SAXS constraints complemented the tertiary-structural information for all the proteins, and that accuracy of the structures thus obtained with SAXS constraints and local geometrical restraints ranged from 1.85 to 4.33 angstrom. Based on these results, we were able to construct a coarse-grained protein model at amino acid residue resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This decade, however, saw the first reports of folding simulations describing kinetics on the order of milliseconds, placing many proteins firmly within reach of these methods. Progress in sampling and forcefield accuracy, however, presents a new challenge: how to turn huge MD datasets into scientific understanding.

Various areas of molecular sciences continue to benefit from, indeed rely on, the unparalleled spatial and temporal resolutions offered by these technologies, to provide a more complete picture of the molecular problems at hand. Because of the continuous development of more efficient algorithms harvesting ever-expanding computational resources, and the emergence of more advanced and novel theories and methodologies, the scope of computational studies has expanded significantly over the past decade, now including much larger molecular systems and far more complex molecular phenomena. Among the various computer modeling techniques, the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and related techniques has particularly drawn attention in biomolecular research, because of the ability of the method to describe the dynamical nature of the molecular systems and thereby to provide a more realistic representation, which is often needed for understanding fundamental molecular properties. The method has proven to be remarkably successful in capturing molecular events and structural transitions highly relevant to the function and/or physicochemical properties of biomolecular systems. Herein, after a brief introduction to the method of MD, we use a number of membrane transport proteins studied in our laboratory as examples to showcase the scope and applicability of the method and its power in characterizing molecular motions of various magnitudes and time scales that are involved in the function of this important class of membrane proteins.","[Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Tajkhorshid, E (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Dept Biochem, 405 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",emad@life.illinois.edu,"Wen, Po-Chao/I-5031-2014; Wen, Po-Chao/Q-5293-2019","Wen, Po-Chao/0000-0002-6049-6904; Wen, Po-Chao/0000-0002-6049-6904; LI, Jing/0000-0003-3277-6818; Tajkhorshid, Emad/0000-0001-8434-1010","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM086749, U54-GM087519, P41-GM104601]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, R01GM086749, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, R01GM086749, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, R01GM086749, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, R01GM086749, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, R01GM086749, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","These studies were supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01-GM086749, U54-GM087519, and P41-GM104601.",,211,38,38,0,60,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0006-2960,,,BIOCHEMISTRY-US,Biochemistry,JAN 29,2013,52,4,,,,,569,587,,10.1021/bi301086x,,,19,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,082KR,WOS:000314391200001,23298176,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2020-11-19,

This involves recording all unphysical crossing events of a ghost chain, and calculating the minimal uncrossing cost that would have been required to avoid such events. A depth-first tree search algorithm is applied to find minimal transformations to fold alpha, beta, alpha/beta, and knotted proteins. In all cases, the extra uncrossing/non-crossing distance is a small fraction of the total distance travelled by a ghost chain. Different structural classes may be distinguished by the amount of extra uncrossing distance, and the effectiveness of such discrimination is compared with other order parameters. It was seen that non-crossing distance over chain length provided the best discrimination between structural and kinetic classes. The scaling of non-crossing distance with chain length implies an inevitable crossover to entanglement-dominated folding mechanisms for sufficiently long chains. We further quantify the minimal folding pathways by collecting the sequence of uncrossing moves, which generally involve leg, loop, and elbow-like uncrossing moves, and rendering the collection of these moves over the unfolded ensemble as a multiple-transformation alignment. The consensus minimal pathway is constructed and shown schematically for representative cases of an alpha, beta, and knotted protein. An overlap parameter is defined between pathways; we find that alpha proteins have minimal overlap indicating diverse folding pathways, knotted proteins are highly constrained to follow a dominant pathway, and beta proteins are somewhere in between. Thus we have shown how topological chain constraints can induce dominant pathway mechanisms in protein folding.","[Mohazab, Ali R.; Plotkin, Steven S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada","Plotkin, SS (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",steve@physics.ubc.ca,"Plotkin, Steven/AAO-3257-2020","Plotkin, Steven/0000-0001-8998-877X",Faculty of Graduate Studies 4YF Program at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver; Natural Sciences and Engineering CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"The authors acknowledge funding from the Faculty of Graduate Studies 4YF Program at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council for providing funding to defray publication page fees.

In the current work, we exploit chemical shifts by combining the basin-hopping approach to global optimization with chemical shift restraints using a penalty function. For three peptides, we demonstrate that this approach allows us to find near-native structures from fully extended structures within 10 000 basin-hopping steps. The effect of adding chemical shift restraints is that the alpha and beta secondary structure elements form within 1000 basin-hopping steps, after which the orientation of the secondary structure elements, which produces the tertiary contacts, is driven by the underlying protein force field. We further show that our chemical shift-restraint BH approach also works for incomplete chemical shift assignments, where the information from only one chemical shift type is considered. For the proper implementation of chemical shift restraints in the basin-hopping approach, we determined the optimal weight of the chemical shift penalty energy with respect to the CHARMM force field in conjunction with the FACTS solvation model employed in this study. In order to speed up the local energy minimization procedure, we developed a function, which continuously decreases the width of the chemical shift penalty function as the minimization progresses. We conclude that the basin-hopping approach with chemical shift restraints is a promising method for protein structure prediction. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

The copolymers were prepared using atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and possess different pendant functional groups in the A and B blocks (alcohols in the A block and acetylenes in the B block). After postfunctionalization, the A block contains o-nitrobenzyl-protected 2-ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) moieties and the B block benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) moieties. While the protected UPy groups dimerize after photoinduced deprotection of the o-nitrobenzyl group, the BTA moieties self-assemble into helical aggregates when temperature is reduced. In a two-step thermal/photoirradiation treatment under dilute conditions, the ABA block copolymer forms both BTA-based helical aggregates and UPy dimers intramolecularly. The sequential association of the two self-assembling motifs results in single-chain folding of the polymer, affording nanometer-sized particles with a compartmentalized interior. Variable-temperature NMR studies showed that the BTA and UPy self-assembly steps take place orthogonally (i.e., without mutual interference) in dilute solution. In addition, monitoring of the intramolecular self-assembly of BTA moieties into helical aggregates by circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that the stability of the aggregates is almost independent of UPy dimerization. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis provided evidence of significant reductions in the hydrodynamic volume and radius of gyration, respectively, after photoinduced deprotection of the UPy groups; a 30-60% reduction in the size of the polymer chains was observed using SEC in CHCl3. Molecular imaging by atomic force microscopy (AFM) corroborated significant contraction of individual polymer chains due to intramolecular association of the BTA and UPy groups. The stepwise folding process resulting from orthogonal self-assembly-induced supramolecular interactions yields compartmentalized SCPNs comprised of distinct microdomains that mimick two secondary-structuring elements in proteins.","[Hosono, Nobuhiko; Gillissen, Martijn A.

However, their role in the biological self-assembly of many molecule systems has not been investigated. Here, using Brownian dynamics simulations, we evaluate the importance of HI on the kinetics of self-assembly of lipid membranes. One-thousand coarse-grained lipid molecules in periodic simulation boxes were allowed to assemble into stable bilayers in the presence and absence of intermolecular HI. Hydrodynamic interactions reduce the monomer-monomer association rate by 50%. In contrast, the rate of association of lipid clusters is much faster in the presence of intermolecular HI. In fact, with intermolecular HI, the membrane self-assembly rate is 3-10 times faster than that without intermolecular HI. We introduce an analytical model to describe the size dependence of the diffusive encounter rate of particle clusters, which can qualitatively explain our simulation results for the early stage of the membrane self-assembly process. These results clearly suggest that HI greatly affects the kinetics of self-assembly and that simulations without HI will significantly underestimate the kinetic parameters of such processes.","[Ando, Tadashi; Skolnick, Jeffrey] Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Study Syst Biol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Skolnick, J (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Ctr Study Syst Biol, Sch Biol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",skolnick@gatech.edu,,,"Division of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM-37408]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408, R01GM037408] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported in part by grant No. GM-37408 of the Division of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.,,43,27,28,0,31,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

However, the fundamental drivers of structural change responsible for the extraordinary diversity of proteins have yet to be elucidated. Here we explore if protein evolution affects folding speed. We estimated folding times for the present-day catalog of protein domains directly from their size-modified contact order. These values were mapped onto an evolutionary timeline of domain appearance derived from a phylogenomic analysis of protein domains in 989 fully-sequenced genomes. Our results show a clear overall increase of folding speed during evolution, with known ultra-fast downhill folders appearing rather late in the timeline. Remarkably, folding optimization depends on secondary structure. While alpha-folds showed a tendency to fold faster throughout evolution, beta-folds exhibited a trend of folding time increase during the last similar to 1.5 billion years that began during the big bang of domain combinations. As a consequence, these domain structures are on average slow folders today. Our results suggest that fast and efficient folding of domains shaped the universe of protein structure. This finding supports the hypothesis that optimization of the kinetic and thermodynamic accessibility of the native fold reduces protein aggregation propensities that hamper cellular functions.","[Debes, Cedric; Graeter, Frauke] Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, Heidelberg, Germany; [Wang, Minglei; Caetano-Anolles, Gustavo] Univ Illinois, Dept Crop Sci, Evolutionary Bioinformat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Graeter, Frauke] CAS MPG Partner Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Graeter, Frauke] Key Lab Computat Biol, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Debes, C (corresponding author), Heidelberg Inst Theoret Studies, Heidelberg, Germany.",gca@illinois.edu; frauke.graeter@h-its.org,"Grater, Frauke/D-3450-2009","Grater, Frauke/0000-0003-2891-3381; Caetano-Anolles, Gustavo/0000-0001-5854-4121",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0749836]; Klaus Tschira Foundation,"This study was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant MCB-0749836 to GCA) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation.

That idea is supported by a theoretical study showing that various MD force-fields provide a consensus picture of protein fluctuations in aqueous solution [Rueda, M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 2007, 104, 796-801]. However, atomistic MD cannot be applied to most biologically relevant processes due to its limitation to relatively short time scales. Much longer time scales can be accessed by properly designed coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the aforementioned consensus view of protein dynamics from short (nanosecond) time scale MD simulations is fairly consistent with the dynamics of the coarse-grained protein model - the CABS model. The CABS model employs stochastic dynamics (a Monte Carlo method) and a knowledge-based force-field, which is not biased toward the native structure of a simulated protein. Since CABS-based dynamics allows for the simulation of entire folding (or multiple folding events) in a single run, integration of the CABS approach with all-atom MD promises a convenient (and computationally feasible) means for the long-time multiscale molecular modeling of protein systems with atomistic resolution.","[Jamroz, Michal; Kolinski, Andrzej; Kmiecik, Sebastian] Univ Warsaw, Lab Theory Biopolymers, Fac Chem, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland; [Orozco, Modesto] Inst Res Biomed, IRB BSC Joint Res Program Computat Biol, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Orozco, Modesto] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biochem, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain","Kmiecik, S (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Lab Theory Biopolymers, Fac Chem, Pasteura 1, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland.",sekmi@chem.uw.edu.pl,"Jamroz, Michal/L-8707-2015","Jamroz, Michal/0000-0002-7255-6476; Orozco Lopez, Modesto/0000-0002-8608-3278","TEAM project [TEAM/2011-7/6]; EU European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU); Polish National Science Center [NN301071140]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [1P2011 024371]","The authors thank Dr. Tim Meyer for critical reading of the manuscript.

The four popular force fields for biomolecular simulations, CHARMM22/CMAP, AMBER FF03, AMBER FF99SB, and OPLS-AA/L, were compared in prediction of conformational propensities of all common proteinogenic amino acids. The minimalistic model of terminally block amino acids (dipeptides) was chosen for assessment of side chain effects on backbone propensities. The precise metadynamics simulations revealed striking inconsistency of trends in conformational preferences as manifested by investigated force fields for both backbone and side chains. To trace this disapproval between force fields, the two related AMBER force fields were studied more closely. In the cases of FF99SB and FF03, we uncovered that the distinct tends were driven by different charge models. Additionally, the effects of recent correction for side chain torsion (FF99SB-LLDN) were examined on affected amino acids and exposed significant coupling between free energy profiles and propensities of backbone and side chain conformers. These findings have important consequences for further force field development.","[Vymetal, Jiri; Vondrasek, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, CR-16610 Prague 6, Czech Republic","Vondrasek, J (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Flemingovo Nam 2, CR-16610 Prague 6, Czech Republic.",jiri.vondrasek@uochb.cas.cz,"Vymetal, Jiri/R-1167-2017; Vondrasek, JIri/A-4244-2008","Vymetal, Jiri/0000-0002-0165-8707; ","Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LH11020]; Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicCzech Academy of Sciences [Z40550506]","This work was supported by KONTAKT II programme LH11020 of Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic.

Our case study is the very flexible glycerol molecule that undergoes interconversion between conformers in a nonrandom way. Along the sequence of structures from one backbone conformer to another, transition states have been identified. The three C-13 NMR chemical shifts of the molecule were estimated by averaging their calculated values over a large set of BOMD snapshots. The simulation time needed to obtain a good agreement with the two signals present in the experimental spectrum is shown to be dependent on the atomic orbital basis set used for the dynamics, with a necessary longer trajectory for the most extended basis sets. The large structural deformations with respect to the optimized conformer geometries that occur along the dynamics are related to a kinetically driven conformer distribution. Calculated conformer type populations are in good agreement with experimental gas phase microwave results.","[Goursot, A.; Mineva, T.] Ecole Chim Montpellier, ICGM, UMR 5253, CNRS, F-34296 Montpellier 5, France; [Vasquez-Perez, J.

In many cases, it is not obvious how molecular structure will change upon association with other molecules. In proteins, these changes can be major, with large deviations in overall backbone structure, or they can be more subtle as in a side-chain rotation. Either way the algorithms that predict the favorability of biomolecular association require relatively accurate predictions of the bound structure to give an accurate assessment of the energy involved in association. Here, we review a number of techniques that have been proposed to accommodate receptor flexibility in the simulation of small molecules binding to protein receptors. We investigate modifications to standard rigid receptor docking algorithms and also explore enhanced sampling techniques, and the combination of free energy calculations and enhanced sampling techniques. The understanding and allowance for receptor flexibility are helping to make computer simulations of ligand protein binding more accurate. These developments may help improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development. Efficiency will be essential as we begin to see personalized medicine tailored to individual patients, which means specific drugs are needed for each patients genetic makeup.","[Sinko, William; McCammon, J.

In this perspective article, we first summarize spectroscopic studies of alanine-based short peptides in aqueous solution. While most studies indicate a preference for the P-II conformation in the unfolded state over alpha and beta conformations, significant variations are also observed. A statistical analysis from various coil libraries of high-resolution protein structures is then summarized, which gives a more coherent view of the local conformational features. The phi, chi, chi distributions of the 20 amino acids have been obtained from a protein coil library, considering both backbone and side-chain conformational preferences. The intrinsic side-chain chi(1) rotamer preference and chi(1)-dependent Ramachandran plot can be generally understood by combining the interaction of the side-chain C gamma/O gamma atom with two neighboring backbone peptide groups. Current all-atom force fields such as AMBER ff99sb-ILDN, ff03 and OPLS-AA/ L do not reproduce these distributions well. A method has been developed by combining the phi, psi plot of alanine with the influence of side-chain chi(1) rotamers to derive the local conformational features of various amino acids. It has been further applied to improve the OPLS-AA force field. The modified force field (OPLS-AA/ C) reproduces experimental (3)J coupling constants for various short peptides quite well. It also better reproduces the temperature-dependence of the helix-coil transition for alanine-based peptides. The new force field can fold a series of peptides and proteins with various secondary structures to their experimental structures. MD simulations of several globular proteins using the improved force field give significantly less deviation (RMSD) to experimental structures. The results indicate that the local conformational features from coil libraries are valuable for the development of balanced protein force fields.","[Jiang, Fan; Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Han, Wei; Wu, Yun-Dong] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Coll Chem, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Wu, YD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",chydwu@ust.hk,"Han, Wei/G-7205-2015; Wu, Yun-Dong/G-8463-2013; Jiang, Fan/E-2771-2012","Han, Wei/0000-0003-0759-1766; ","Research Grants Council of Hong KongHong Kong Research Grants Council [663509]; Shenzhen Peacock Program [KQTD201103]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21133002, 21203004]","We are grateful for the financial support from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (663509), the Shenzhen Peacock Program (KQTD201103), and the National Science Foundation of China (21133002, 21203004).

Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses performed in water, ethanol and ethanol/water 9/1 v/v (M1) show in M1 and ethanol that B1 and B2 form stable complexes with Na+, K+ and Cs+. Affinity constants, measured spectrophotometrically in ethanol and M1, by the use of the SPECFIT program, are in the 10(5) and 10(6) range for B1 and B2, respectively. The second-order rate constants are in the 10(6)-10(7) M-1 s(-1) range and the first-order rate constants about unity. The ratios of the second-order/first-order rate constants confirm the thermodynamic results in EtOH. The kinetic processes become much too fast to allow runs in M1. Molecular simulations in EtOH imply the existence of two isomers for each of the Cs+/B1 and Cs+/B2 complexes. With B1, the more stable one is that in which the two enolates are parallel and mimic the alkali-metal inclusion cavity already envisaged for norbadione A. With B2, two similar structures are extracted, in both of which Cs+ is included in the crown ether and capped by the enolate. The affinity of B1 for Cs+ is comparable to that of norbadione A, whereas that of B2 is higher. These results are encouraging as they introduce a new series of alkali chelators which can lead to molecules capable of complexing Cs-137(+) for radioactive decontamination. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

From a computational point of view, the identification of the conformations that build out the transition state is particularly cumbersome, mainly because of the large computational cost of generating a statistically sound set of folding trajectories. Here we show that a biasing algorithm, based on the physics of the ratchet-and-pawl, can be used to approximate efficiently the transition state. The basic idea is that the algorithmic ratchet exerts a force on the protein when it is climbing the free-energy barrier, while it is inactive when it is descending. The transition state can be identified as the point of the trajectory where the ratchet changes regime. Besides discussing this strategy in general terms, we test it within a protein model whose transition state can be studied independently by plain molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we show its power in explicit-solvent simulations, obtaining and characterizing a set of transition-state conformations for Acyl-Coenzyme A-Binding Protein (ACBP) and Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI2).

Consistent with theory and single-molecule experiment, duration of the folding transition paths exhibits only a weak correlation with overall folding time. Conformational distributions of folding trajectories near the overall thermodynamic folding/unfolding barrier show significant deviations from preequilibrium. These deviations, the distribution of transition path times, and the variation of mean transition path time for different proteins can all be rationalized by a diffusive process that we modeled using simple Monte Carlo algorithms with an effective coordinate-independent diffusion coefficient. Conformations in the initial stages of transition paths tend to form more nonlocal contacts than typical conformations with the same number of native contacts. This statistical bias, which is indicative of preferred folding pathways, should be amenable to future single-molecule measurements. We found that the preexponential factor defined in the transition state theory of folding varies from protein to protein and that this variation can be rationalized by our Monte Carlo diffusion model. Thus, protein folding physics is different in certain fundamental respects from the physics envisioned by a simple transition-state picture. Nonetheless, transition state theory can be a useful approximate predictor of cooperative folding speed, because the height of the overall folding barrier is apparently a proxy for related rate-determining physical properties.","[Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; Univ Toronto, Dept Phys, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,"Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs,We thank the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Research Chairs Program for financial support as well as Compute Canada and President Foundation B of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences for computational resources.,,66,29,29,0,54,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

In the method, groups of residues are assigned to foldons and these foldons are used to map the conformational space of the protein onto a set of discrete macrobasins. The free energies of the individual macrobasins are then calculated, informing practical kinetic analysis. Two simple assumptions about the universality of the rate for downhill transitions between macrobasins and the natural local connectivity between macrobasins lead to a scheme for predicting overall folding and unfolding rates, generating chevron plots under varying thermodynamic conditions, and inferring dominant kinetic folding pathways. To illustrate the approach, free energies of macrobasins were calculated from biased simulations of a non-additive structure-based model using two structurally motivated foldon definitions at the full and half ankyrin repeat resolutions. The calculated chevrons have features consistent with those measured in stopped flow chemical denaturation experiments. The dominant inferred folding pathway has an inside-out'', nucleation-propagation like character.","[Schafer, Nicholas P.; Hoffman, Ryan M.

In simulations involving biological macromolecules, the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic) force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule, such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for straightforward implementation of CGenFF's complicated atom typing rules and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically verify its different components.

Different techniques have been used to follow the motion of a protein over this landscape and thus quantify its properties. However, these techniques often are limited to short timescales and low-energy conformations. Here, we describe a general approach that overcomes these limitations. Starting from a nonnative conformation held by an aromatic disulfide bond, we use time-resolved spectroscopy to observe nonequilibrium backbone dynamics over nine orders of magnitude in time, from picoseconds to milliseconds, after photolysis of the disulfide bond. We find that the reencounter probability of residues that initially are in close contact decreases with time following an unusual power law that persists over the full time range and is independent of the primary sequence. Model simulations show that this power law arises from subdiffusional motion, indicating a wide distribution of trapping times in local minima of the energy landscape, and enable us to quantify the roughness of the energy landscape (4-5 k(B)T). Surprisingly, even under denaturing conditions, the energy landscape remains highly rugged with deep traps (>20 k(B)T) that result from multiple nonnative interactions and are sufficient for trapping on the millisecond timescale. Finally, we suggest that the subdiffusional motion of the protein backbone found here may promote rapid folding of proteins with low contact order by enhancing contact formation between nearby residues.","[Dev, Sagarika; Volk, Martin] Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Milanesi, Lilia; Waltho, Jonathan P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Milanesi, Lilia; Hunter, Christopher A.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Chem, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Waltho, Jonathan P.] Manchester Inst Biotechnol, Manchester M1 7DN, Lancs, England; [Shaw, Daniel J.; Beddard, Godfrey S.; Reid, Gavin D.] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Volk, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",m.volk@liv.ac.uk,"Volk, Martin/J-2912-2012; Beddard, Godfrey/M-7072-2013; Shaw, Daniel John/N-5692-2019; Shaw, Daniel/R-3603-2017","Shaw, Daniel John/0000-0003-0090-2947; Shaw, Daniel/0000-0003-0090-2947; Waltho, Jonathan/0000-0002-7402-5492",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BBS/B/10218] Funding Source: researchfish,The authors thank Dr. Julia Weinstein (University of Sheffield) for the loan of an Ar-ion laser.

The term refers to three broad questions: (i) What is the physical code by which an amino acid sequence dictates a protein's native structure? (ii) How can proteins fold so fast? (iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.","[Dill, Ken A.; MacCallum, Justin L.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dill, Ken A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Dill, Ken A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Dill, KA (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",dill@laufercenter.org,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM34993]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993, R01GM034993] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the NIH for support from NIH GM34993.

The protein can also adopt an inactive latent conformation that has the RCL inserted as a central strand in beta-sheet A. This latent form is thermodynamically more stable than the active conformation. Nonetheless, folding of alpha(1)AT consistently yields the active state. The reasons that the metastable form is kinetically preferred remain controversial. The current work demonstrates that a carefully orchestrated folding mechanism prevents RCL insertion into sheet A. Temporal changes in solvent accessibility during folding are monitored using pulsed oxidative labeling and mass spectrometry. The data obtained in this way complement recent hydrogen/deuterium exchange results. Those hydrogen/deuterium exchange measurements revealed that securing of the RCL by hydrogen bonding of the first beta-strand in sheet C is one factor that favors formation of the active conformation. The oxidative labeling data presented here reveal that this anchoring is preceded by the formation of hydrophobic contacts in a confined region of the protein. This partial collapse sequesters the RCL insertion site early on and is therefore instrumental in steering alpha(1)AT towards its active conformation. RCL anchoring by hydrogen bonding starts to contribute at a later stage. Together, these two factors ensure that formation of the active conformation is kinetically favored. This work demonstrates how the use of complementary labeling techniques can provide insights into the mechanisms of protracted folding reactions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 3373), has been further optimized, aiming to improve its efficiency for folding simulations. Backbone hydration parameters have been reoptimized based on hydration free energies of polyalanyl peptides through atomistic simulations. Also, atomistic partial charges from all-atom force fields were combined with PACE to provide a more realistic description of interactions between charged groups. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics, ab initio folding using the new PACE has been achieved for seven small proteins (16-23 residues) with different structural motifs. Experimental data about folded states, such as their stability at room temperature, melting point, and nuclear magnetic resonance nuclear Overhauser effect constraints, were also well reproduced. Moreover, a systematic comparison of folding kinetics at room temperature has been made with experiments, through standard molecular dynamics simulations, showing that the new PACE may accelerate the actual folding kinetics 5-10-fold, permitting now the study of folding mechanisms. In particular, we used the new PACE to fold a 73-residue protein, alpha 3D, in multiple 10-30 mu s simulations, to its native states (C-alpha root-mean-square deviation of similar to 0.34 nm). Our results suggest the potential applicability of the new PACE for the study of folding and dynamics of proteins.","[Schulten, Klaus] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Schulten, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",kschulte@ks.uiuc.edu,"Han, Wei/G-7205-2015","Han, Wei/0000-0003-0759-1766","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [9P41GM104601, P41-RR005969, R01-GM067887]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB02-34938]; Texas Advanced Computing Center [MCA93S028]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM067887, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, R01GM067887, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM067887, R01GM067887, R01GM067887, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work is supported by National Institutes of Health Grants 9P41GM104601, P41-RR005969, and R01-GM067887 and National Science Foundation Grant MCB02-34938.

Here, we address how the energy landscape theory can be applied to these slow folding reactions. Combining the perfect-funnel approximation with a multiscale method, we first extended our previous atomic-interaction based coarse grained (AICG) model to take into account local flexibility of protein molecules. Using this model, we then investigated the energy landscapes and folding routes of two proteins with complex topologies: a multidomain protein adenylate kinase (AKE) and a knotted protein 2ouf-knot. In the AKE folding, consistent with experimental results, the kinetic free energy surface showed several substates between the fully unfolded and native states. We characterized the structural features of these substates and transitions among them, finding temperature-dependent multiroute folding. For protein 2ouf-knot, we found that the improved atomic-interaction based coarse-grained model can spontaneously tie a knot and fold the protein with a probability up to 96%. The computed folding rate of the knotted protein was much slower than that of its unknotted counterpart, in agreement with experimental findings. Similar to the AKE case, the 2ouf-knot folding exhibited several substates and transitions among them. Interestingly, we found a dead-end substate that lacks the knot, thus suggesting backtracking mechanisms.","[Li, Wenfei; Wang, Wei] Nanjing Univ, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenfei; Wang, Wei] Nanjing Univ, Dept Phys, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Wenfei; Terakawa, Tsuyoshi; Takada, Shoji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Li, Wenfei; Takada, Shoji] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolut Sci & Technol, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Wang, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wangwei@nju.edu.cn; takada@biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Takada, Shoji/A-1163-2009; Li, Wenfei/A-1814-2011","Li, Wenfei/0000-0003-2679-4075","Research and Development of the Next-Generation Integrated Simulation of Living Matter of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11111140012, 11174134, 91127026, 10834002]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [22370057] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was based on a joint project between the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas Molecular Science of Fluctuations Toward Biological Functions, by Research and Development of the Next-Generation Integrated Simulation of Living Matter of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants Nos. 11111140012, 11174134, 91127026, and 10834002), and by a project funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,46,82,84,2,45,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We find that this method yields improved thermal melts compared to heating a sample chamber or microscope stage. By comparing results for six cells with in vitro data, we show that the protein is stabilized by about 6 kJ/mole in the cytoplasm, but the temperature dependence of folding kinetics is similar to in vitro. The main difference is a slightly steeper temperature dependence of the folding rate in some cells that can be rationalized in terms of temperature-dependent crowding, local viscosity, or hydrophobicity. The observed rate coefficients can be fitted within measurement uncertainty by an effective two-state model, even though PGK folds by a multistate mechanism.

We find that the magnitude of internal friction correlates with the compactness of the unfolded protein: its contribution dominates the reconfiguration time of approximately 100 ns of the compact unfolded state of a small cold shock protein under native conditions, but decreases for more expanded chains, and approaches zero both at high denaturant concentrations and in intrinsically disordered proteins that are expanded due to intramolecular charge repulsion. Our results suggest that internal friction in the unfolded state will be particularly relevant for the kinetics of proteins that fold in the microsecond range or faster. The low internal friction in expanded intrinsically disordered proteins may have implications for the dynamics of their interactions with cellular binding partners.","[Cheng, Ryan R.; Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Cheng, Ryan R.; Makarov, Dmitrii E.] Univ Texas Austin, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Soranno, Andrea; Buchli, Brigitte; Nettels, Daniel; Mueller-Spaeth, Sonja; Hoffmann, Armin; Schuler, Benjamin] Univ Zurich, Inst Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pfeil, Shawn H.; Lipman, Everett A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Makarov, DE (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem & Biochem, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",makarov@mail.utexas.edu; schuler@bioc.uzh.ch,"Soranno, Andrea/L-6192-2013; Cheng, Ryan/J-5176-2015; Schuler, Benjamin/E-7342-2011","Schuler, Benjamin/0000-0002-5970-4251; Cheng, Ryan/0000-0001-6378-295X; Stucki-Buchli, Brigitte/0000-0002-6756-0665; Soranno, Andrea/0000-0001-8394-7993","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); NCCR for Structural Biology; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 0848571, PHY05-51164]; Robert A.

An analysis of the villin headpiece and FiP35 WW domain detects multiple native substates that are consistent with experimental data. Applying the same protocol to GTT, NTL9, and protein G suggests that some beta containing proteins can form long-lived native-like states with small register shifts.

We recently introduced the boxed molecular dynamics (BXD) method, which accelerates rare events, and simultaneously provides both kinetic and thermodynamic information. We illustrate how the BXD method may be used to obtain high-resolution kinetic data from explicit MD simulations, spanning picoseconds to microseconds. The method is applied to investigate the loop formation dynamics and kinetics of cyclisation for a range of polypeptides, and recovers a power law dependence of the instantaneous rate coefficient over six orders of magnitude in time, in good agreement with experimental observations. Analysis of our BXD results shows that this power law behaviour arises when there is a broad and nearly uniform spectrum of reaction rate coefficients. For the systems investigated in this work, where the free energy surfaces have relatively small barriers, the kinetics is very sensitive to the initial conditions: strongly non-equilibrium conditions give rise to power law kinetics, while equilibrium initial conditions result in a rate coefficient with only a weak dependence on time. These results suggest that BXD may offer us a powerful and general algorithm for describing kinetics and thermodynamics in chemical and biochemical systems. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Simulations begin from a realistic unfolded state devoid of secondary structure and use a chain representation lacking explicit side chains, rendering the simulations many orders of magnitude faster than molecular dynamics simulations. The multiple round nature of the algorithm mimics the authentic folding process and tests the effectiveness of sequential stabilization (SS) as a search strategy wherein 2 structural elements add onto existing structures in a process of progressive learning and stabilization of structure found in prior rounds of folding. Because no a priori knowledge is used, we can identify kinetically significant non-native interactions and intermediates, sometimes generated by only two mutations, while the evolution of contact matrices is often consistent with experiments. Moreover, structure prediction improves substantially by incorporating information from prior rounds. The success of our simple, homology-free approach affirms the validity of our description of the primary determinants of folding pathways and structure, and the effectiveness of SS as a search strategy.","[Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Adhikari, Aashish N.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Freed, Karl F.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Freed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",freed@uchicago.edu; trsosnic@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM55694, S10 RR029030-01]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1111918, OCI-0821678, OCI-1148443]; University of Chicago-Argonne National Laboratory Seed Grant Program; UTexas/TACC [TG-MCB090169]; Open Science Grid/XSEDE ExTENCI program (NSF) [OCI-1007115]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [S10RR029030] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R29GM055694] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1148443] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1148443] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank S.

However, high levels of HIF-1 alpha protein were observed even in normoxic metastatic tumors with normal expression of wild type PHD2. PHD2 malfunctions due to protein misfolding may be the underlying reason of metastasis and invasion in such cases. In this study, we scrutinize the unfolding pathways of the PHD2 catalytic domain's possible species and demonstrate the properties of their unfolding states by computational approaches.

Based on previously determined rate constants for a complex Markovian model describing the gating of homotetrameric HCN2 channels, we analyzed probability fluxes within this model, including unidirectional probability fluxes and the probability flux along transition paths. The time-dependent probability fluxes quantify the contributions of all 13 transitions of the model to channel activation. The binding of the first, third and fourth ligand evoked robust channel opening whereas the binding of the second ligand obstructed channel opening similar to the empty channel. Analysis of the net probability fluxes in terms of the transition path theory revealed pronounced hysteresis for channel activation and deactivation.

In recent years, both experimental and computational approaches have been developed to study the conformational behaviour of this type of protein. It has been shown previously that experimental RDCs (residual dipolar couplings) can be used to study the backbone sampling of disordered proteins in some detail. In these studies, the backbone structure was modelled using a common geometry for all amino acids. In the present paper, we demonstrate that experimental RDCs are also sensitive to the specific geometry of each amino acid as defined by energy-minimized internal co-ordinates. We have modified the FM (flexible-Meccano) algorithm that constructs conformational ensembles on the basis of a statistical coil model, to account for these differences. The modified algorithm inherits the advantages of the FM algorithm to efficiently sample the potential energy landscape for coil conformations. The specific geometries incorporated in the new algorithm result in a better reproduction of experimental RDCs and are generally applicable for further studies to characterize the conformational properties of intrinsically disordered proteins. In addition, the internal-co-ordinate-based algorithm is an order of magnitude more efficient, and facilitates side-chain construction, surface osmolyte simulation, spin-label distribution sampling and proline cis/trans isomer simulation.","[Huang, Jie-rong; Blackledge, Martin] CEA CNRS UJF UMR 5075, Inst Biol Struct Jean Pierre Ebel, F-38027 Grenoble, France; [Gentner, Martin; Vajpai, Navratna; Grzesiek, Stephan] Univ Basel, Div Struct Biol, Biozentrum, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland","Blackledge, M (corresponding author), CEA CNRS UJF UMR 5075, Inst Biol Struct Jean Pierre Ebel, 41 Rue Jules Horowitz, F-38027 Grenoble, France.",martin.blackledge@ibs.fr,"Huang, Jie-rong/O-3661-2019","Huang, Jie-rong/0000-0003-3674-2228; Grzesiek, Stephan/0000-0003-1998-4225","FINOVI; MALZ TAU-STRUCT grant from Agence Nationale de Recherche (France)French National Research Agency (ANR); National Science Council of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","We acknowledge financial support from FINOVI, a MALZ TAU-STRUCT grant from the Agence Nationale de Recherche (France) and the National Science Council of Taiwan (to J.-r.H.)",,44,10,10,0,22,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"THIRD FLOOR, EAGLE HOUSE, 16 PROCTER STREET, LONDON WC1V 6 NX, ENGLAND",0300-5127,,,BIOCHEM SOC T,Biochem.

When working on a particular disease-related biochemical pathway, it is of crucial importance to carefully select druggable protein binding pockets among all those cavities that may appear transiently or permanently on the respective protein surface. In this review, we will focus on the conformational dynamics of proteins that governs the formation and disappearance of such transient pockets on protein surfaces. We will also touch on the issue of druggability of transiently formed pockets. For example, protein cavities suitable to bind small drug-like molecules show an increased pocket size and buriedness when compared to empty sites. Interestingly, we observed in molecular dynamics simulations of five different protein systems that the conformational transitions on the protein surface occur almost barrier-less and large pockets are found at similar frequencies as small pockets, see below. Thus, the dynamical processes at protein surfaces are better visualized as fluid-like motion than as energetically activated events. We conclude by comparing two computational tools, EPOS and MDpocket, for identifying transient pockets in PDK1 kinase. We illustrate how the obtained results depend on the way in which corresponding pockets in different molecular dynamics snapshots are connected to each other.","[Ulucan, Ozlem; Eyrisch, Susanne; Helms, Volkhard] Ctr Bioinformat, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany","Helms, V (corresponding author), Ctr Bioinformat, Bldg E2 1,POB 151150, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany.",volkhard.helms@bioinformatik.uni-saarland.de,"Ulucan, Ozlem/K-8410-2018","Ulucan, Ozlem/0000-0002-7442-5728; Helms, Volkhard/0000-0002-2180-9154",,,,62,18,19,0,34,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1381-6128,1873-4286,,CURR PHARM DESIGN,Curr.

There are a large number of highly resolved X-ray structures and several hundred mutations that have been characterized functionally. Despite this, the molecular details of the catalytic cycle, a cycle that includes large conformational changes, is not fully understood. In this computational study, we provide molecular dynamics descriptions of conformational changes during the E2 --> E1 transitions. The motivating point for these calculations was a series of insertion mutants in the A-M3 linker region that led to significant shifts in measured rates between the E2 and El states, as shown by experimental characterization. Using coarse-grained dynamic importance sampling within the context of a population shift framework, we sample on the intermediates along the transition pathway to address the mechanism for the conformational changes and the effects of the insertion mutations on the kinetics of the transition. The calculations define an approximation for the relative changes in entropy and enthalpy along the transition. These are found to be important for understanding the experimentally observed differences in rates. In particular, the interactions between cytoplasmic domains, water interactions, and the shifts in protein degrees of freedom with the insertion mutations show mutual compensation for the E2 --> E1 transitions in wild-type and mutant systems.

There are numerous alternative ways of associating individual configurations into collective states, and in deciding on the number of such clustered states there is a trade-off between human interpretability (smaller number of states) and accuracy of representation (larger number of states). Here we introduce a trajectory likelihood measure for assessing alternative discrete state models of protein folding. We find that widely used rmsd-based clustering methods require large numbers of initial states and a second agglomeration step based on kinetic connectivity to produce models with high predictive power; this is the approach taken in elegant recent work with Markov State Models of protein folding. In contrast, we find that grouping of states based on secondary structure pairings or contact maps, when refined with K-means clustering, yields higher likelihood models with many fewer states. Using the most predictive contact map representation to study the folding transitions of the WW domain in very long molecular dynamics simulations, we identify new states and transitions. The methods should be generally useful for investigating the structural transitions in protein folding simulations for larger proteins.","[Kellogg, Elizabeth H.; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Lange, Oliver F.] Tech Univ Munich, Biomol NMR, Dept Chem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Lange, Oliver F.] Tech Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Integrated Prot Sci, Dept Chem, D-85747 Garching, Germany; [Lange, Oliver F.] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Biol Struct, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany","Baker, D (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",dabaker@u.washington.edu,"Baker, David/K-8941-2012; Lange, Oliver/K-5749-2012","Baker, David/0000-0001-7896-6217; Lange, Oliver/0000-0002-4018-7020",DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [LA 1817/3-1],"We thank Greg Bowman and T.

Whereas so far the focus has mainly been on rupture or unfolding forces, recent force-probe molecular dynamics simulations have revealed a strong loading rate dependence of biomolecular elasticities, which cannot be explained by the established one-dimensional transition-state treatments. We show that this nonequilibrium behavior can be explained by a theory that includes relaxation effects. For three structurally and mechanically quite diverse systems, a single relaxation mode suffices to quantitatively describe their loading-rate-dependent elastic behavior. Atomistic simulations of these systems revealed the microscopic nature of the respective relaxation modes. This result suggests a new type of elasticity spectroscopy experiment, which should render nonequilibrium properties of structured macromolecules accessible to single-molecule force spectroscopy.","[Kappel, Christian; Doelker, Nicole; Kumar, Rajendra; Zink, Mareike; Zachariae, Ulrich; Grubmueller, Helmut] MPI Biophys Chem, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Doelker, Nicole] CNIO, Computat Biophys Grp, Madrid 28029, Spain; [Zink, Mareike] Univ Leipzig, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Zachariae, Ulrich] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Phys & Astron, SUPA, Edinburgh EH9 3JZ, Midlothian, Scotland","Kappel, C (corresponding author), MPI Biophys Chem, Fassberg 11, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",hgrubmu@gwdg.de,"Zink, Mareike/D-8454-2016; Dolker, Nicole/M-3288-2014","Zink, Mareike/0000-0002-3603-3483; Kumar, Rajendra/0000-0002-7268-9519; Zachariae, Ulrich/0000-0003-3287-8494; Dolker, Nicole/0000-0002-4284-3212",HFSPHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP 53/2004]; EUEuropean Union (EU) [211800],"We acknowledge funding by HFSP (RGP 53/2004) and the EU (FP6-2004-NEST-PATH, Nanomot, and FP7 Grant Agreement No. 211800).

We have studied CLN025, an optimized ten residue synthetic peptide, which adopts a compact, well-structured beta-hairpin conformation. Formation of the component beta-sheet and beta-turn structures of CLN025 was probed independently using a combination of equilibrium Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and laser-induced temperature jump coupled with time-resolved infrared and fluorescence spectroscopies. We find that CLN025 is an ultrafast folder due to its small free energy barrier to folding and that it exceeds the predicted speed limit for beta-hairpin formation by an order of magnitude. We also find that the folding mechanism cannot be described by a simple two-state model, but rather is a heterogeneous process involving two independent parallel processes. Formation of stabilizing cross-strand hydrophobic interactions and turn alignment occur competitively, with relaxation lifetimes of 82 +/- 10 and 124 +/- 10 ns, respectively, at the highest probed temperature. The ultrafast and heterogeneous folding kinetics observed for CLN025 provide evidence for folding on a nearly barrierless free energy landscape, and recalibrate the speed limit for the formation of a beta-hairpin.","[Xiao, Shifeng; Raeigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Davis, Caitlin M.; Dyer, R.

A recently revised version of the additive CHARMM protein force field, which includes optimization of the backbone CMAP potential to achieve good balance between different types of secondary structure, correcting the alpha-helical bias present in the former CHARMM22/CMAP energy function, is shown to result in improved cooperativity for the helix-coil transition. This is due to retention of the empirical corrections introduced in the original CMAP to reproduce folded protein structures-corrections that capture many-body effects missing from an energy surface fitted to gas phase calculations on dipeptides. The experimental temperature dependence of helix formation in (AAQAA)(3) and parameters for helix nucleation and elongation are in much better agreement with experiment than those obtained with other recent force fields. In contrast, CMAP parameters derived by fitting to a vacuum quantum mechanical surface for the alanine dipeptide do not reproduce the enhanced cooperativity, showing that the empirical backbone corrections, and not some other feature of the force field, are responsible. We also find that the cooperativity of beta-hairpin formation is much improved relative to other force fields we have studied. Comparison with (phi, psi) distributions from the Protein Data Bank further justifies the inclusion of many-body effects in the CMAP.

It includes (1) a molecular mechanics (MM) part based on a 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential; (2) an electrostatic component based on an implicit solvent model (ISM) with individual desolvation penalties for each partner in the protein-protein complex plus a hydrogen bonding term; and (3) a surface area (SA) contribution to account for the loss of water contacts upon protein-protein complex formation. The accuracy and performance of the scoring function, termed MM-ISMSA, have been assessed by (1) comparing the total binding energies, the electrostatic term, and its components (charge-charge and individual desolvation energies), as well as the per residue contributions, to results obtained with well-established methods such as APBSA or MM-PB(GB)SA for a set of 1242 decoy protein-protein complexes and (2) testing its ability to recognize the docking solution closest to the experimental structure as that providing the most favorable total binding energy. For this purpose, a test set consisting of 15 protein-protein complexes with known 3D structure mixed with 10 decoys for each complex was used. The correlation between the values afforded by MM-ISMSA and those from the other methods is quite remarkable (r(2) similar to 0.9), and only 0.2-5.0 s (depending on the number of residues) are spent on a single calculation including an all vs all pairwise energy decomposition. On the other hand, MM-ISMSA correctly identifies the best docking solution as that closest to the experimental structure in 80% of the cases.

In contrast to structured proteins, free IDPs exist as heterogeneous and dynamical conformational ensembles under physiological conditions. Many concepts have been discussed on how such intrinsic disorder may provide crucial functional advantages, particularly in cellular signaling and regulation. Establishing the physical basis of these proposed phenomena requires not only detailed characterization of the disordered conformational ensembles, but also mechanistic understanding of the roles of various ensemble properties in IDP interaction and regulation. Here, we review the experimental and computational approaches that may be integrated to address many important challenges of establishing a structural basis of IDP function, and discuss some of the key emerging ideas on how the conformational ensembles of IDPs may mediate function, especially in coupled binding and folding interactions.

Non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) are a class of highly specific drugs which bind to a pocket approximately 10 A from the polymerase active site, inhibiting the enzyme allosterically. It is widely believed that NNRTIs function as molecular wedges, disrupting the region between thumb and palm subdomains of the p66 subunit and locking the thumb in a wide-open conformation. Crystal structure data suggest that the binding of NNRTIs forces RT into a wide-open conformation in which the separation between the thumb and fingers subdomains is much higher than in the apo structure. Using ensemble molecular dynamics simulations (aggregate sampling similar to 600 ns), we have captured RT bound to the NNRTI efavirenz in a closed conformation similar to that of the apo enzyme, suggesting the constraint of thumb motion is not as complete as previously believed. Rather, our investigation confirms that a conformational distribution across open and closed states must exist in the drug-bound enzyme and that allosteric modulation is effected via the alteration of the kinetic landscape of conformational transitions upon drug-binding. A more detailed understanding of the mechanism of NNRTI inhibition and the effect of binding upon domain motion could aid the design of more effective inhibitors and help identify novel allosteric sites.","[Wright, David W.; Coveney, Peter V.] UCL, Dept Chem, Ctr Computat Sci, London WC1H 0AJ, England; [Sadiq, S.

Here, we present a refined version of the coarse-grained optimized potential for efficient protein structure prediction (OPEP) based on a six-bead representation. The OPEP version 4.0 parameter set, which uses a new analytical formulation for the nonbonded interactions and adds specific side-chain-side-chain interactions for alpha-helix, is subjected to three tests. First, we show that molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K preserve the experimental rigid conformations of 17 proteins with 37-152 amino acids within a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.1 angstrom after 30 ns. Extending the simulation time to 100 ns for five proteins does not change the RMSDs. Second, replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations recover the NMR structures of three prototypical beta-hairpin and alpha-helix peptides and the NMR three-stranded beta-sheet topology of a 37-residue WW domain, starting from randomly chosen states. Third, REMD simulations on the cc beta peptide show a temperature transition from a three-stranded coiled coil to amyloid-like aggregates consistent with experiments, while simulations on low molecular weight aggregates of the prion protein helix 1 do not. Overall, these studies indicate the effectiveness of our OPEP4 coarse-grained model for protein folding and aggregation, and report two future directions for improvement.","[Chebaro, Yassmine; Pasquali, Samuela; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, UPR 9080, Lab Biochim Theor, CNRS,Inst Biol Physicochim, F-75005 Paris, France; [Derreumaux, Philippe] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, UPR 9080, Lab Biochim Theor, CNRS,Inst Biol Physicochim, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Chebaro, Yassmine/M-2174-2019; Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019","Chebaro, Yassmine/0000-0002-5970-2117; pasquali, samuela/0000-0003-1487-0894",,,,135,73,73,0,47,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

The two variants were wild-type recombinant and Glu1-deletion (E1M) variants expressed in Escherichia coli. The presence of an extra methionine at the N terminus in recombinant a-lactalbumin destabilized the protein by 2 kcal/mol, while the stability was recovered in the E1M variant in which Glu1 was replaced by Met1. Kinetic folding/unfolding reactions of the proteins, induced by stopped-flow concentration jumps of guanidine hydrochloride, indicated the presence of a burst-phase in refolding, and gave chevron plots with significant curvatures in both the folding and unfolding limbs. The folding-limb curvature was interpreted in terms of accumulation of the burst-phase intermediate. However, there was no burst phase observed in the unfolding kinetics to interpret the unfolding-limb curvature. We thus assumed a sequential four-state mechanism, in which the folding from the burst-phase intermediate takes place via two transition states separated by a high-energy intermediate. We estimated changes in the free energies of the burst-phase intermediate and two transition states, caused by the N-terminal variations and also by the presence of stabilizing calcium ions. The F values at the N terminus and at the Ca2+-binding site thus obtained increased successively during folding, demonstrating the validity of the sequential mechanism. The stability and the folding behavior of the E1M variant were essentially identical to those of the authentic protein, allowing us to use this variant as a pseudo-wild-type a-lactalbumin in future studies.

Conformational variability can be described by dividing a biomolecule into dynamic domains, i.e., by finding compact fragments that move as coherent units. Typical approaches, based on calculating a dynamical cross-correlation matrix, are limited by their inability to reveal correlated rotations and anticorrelated motions. We propose a geometric approach for finding dynamic domains, where we compare traces of atomic movements in a pairwise manner, and search for their best superposition. A quaternion representation of rotation is used to simplify the complex. calculations The algorithm was implemented in a Java graphical program: Geometrically Stable Substructures (GeoStaS). The program processes PDB and DCD binary files with large structural sets for proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. We demonstrate its efficiency in analyzing (a) ensembles of structures generated by NMR experiments and (b) conformation sets from biomolecular simulations, such as molecular dynamics. The results provide a clear description of the molecular movements even for large biomolecules. Compared to a standard dynamic cross-correlation matrix, our algorithm detects the correlations in both translational and rotational motions.","[Romanowska, Julia] Univ Warsaw, Fac Phys, Dept Biophys, PL-00681 Warsaw, Poland; [Romanowska, Julia; Nowinski, Krzysztof S.] Univ Warsaw, Interdisciplinary Ctr Math & Computat Modelling I, PL-02106 Warsaw, Poland; [Trylska, Joanna] Univ Warsaw, Ctr New Technol CeNT, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland","Romanowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Phys, Dept Biophys, Hoza 69, PL-00681 Warsaw, Poland.",jrom@icm.edu.pl,,"Trylska, Joanna/0000-0002-1464-5323; Romanowska, Julia/0000-0001-6733-1953","University of Warsaw [BST G31-4, ICM G31-4]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [N N301 245236, N N301 033339]; Foundation for Polish Science (Focus program and Team project) [TEAM/2009-3/8]; European Regional Development Fund within Innovative Economy Operational Programme",This work was supported by the University of Warsaw [BST and ICM G31-4]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N N301 245236 and N N301 033339]; and Foundation for Polish Science (Focus program and Team project [TEAM/2009-3/8] cofinanced by European Regional Development Fund operated within Innovative Economy Operational Programme).,,57,15,15,0,19,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Our simulations show that the uncapped peptide folds into a native like beta-hairpin structure at 310 K when Amber f199SB-ILDN, Amber ff99SB*-ILDN, Amber ff99SB, Amber ff99SB*, Amber ff03, Amber ff03*, GROMOS96 43a1p, or GROMOS96 53a6 were used The CHARMM27 simulations were able to form native hairpins in some of the elevated temperature simulations, while the OPLS-AA/L simulations did not yield native hairpin structures at any temperatures tested. Simulations that used charge groups or peptide capping groups were not largely different from their uncapped counterparts with single atom charge groups On the other hand, phosphorylation of the threonine residue located at the beta-turn significantly affected the hairpin formation. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing such a large set of force fields with respect to beta-hairpin folding. Such a comprehensive comparison will offer useful guidance to others conducting similar types of simulations.","[Cino, Elio A.; Choy, Wing-Yiu] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada; [Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Waterloo, Dept Chem, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada","Choy, WY (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biochem, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 5C1, Canada.",jchoy4@uwo.ca; mikko.karttunen@uwaterloo.ca,"Karttunen, Mikko/G-4531-2010; Choy, Wing-Yiu/O-7608-2017","Karttunen, Mikko/0000-0002-8626-3033; Choy, Wing-Yiu/0000-0002-2124-7278",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [74679]; Ontario Early Researcher Program,"We would like to thank Martin Ulmschneider for critical reading of this manuscript.

Experimentally, proteins often appear to fold via simple two- or three-state mechanisms involving mainly native-state interactions, yet recent network models built from atomistic these two pictures in a combined experimental and simuation simulations of small proteins suggest the existence of many possible metastable states and folding pathways. We reconcile study of acyl-coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP), a two-state folder (folding time similar to 10 ms) exhibiting residual unfolded-state structure, and a putative early folding intermediate. Using single-molecule FRET in conjunction with side-chain mutagenesis, we first demonstrate that the denatured state of ACBP at near-zero denaturant is unusually compact and enriched in long-range structure that can be perturbed by discrete hydrophobic core mutations. We then employ ultrafast laminar-flow mixing experiments to study the folding kinetics of ACBP on the microsecond time scale. These studies, along with Trp-Cys quenching measurements of unfolded-state dynamics, suggest that unfolded-state structure forms on a surprisingly slow (similar to 100 mu s) time scale, and that sequence mutations strikingly perturb both time-resolved and equilibrium smFRET measurements in a similar way. A Markov state model (MSM) of the ACBP folding reaction, constructed from over 30 ms of molecular dynamics trajectory data, predicts a complex network of metastable stables, residual unfolded-state structure, and kinetics consistent with experiment but no well-defined intermediate preceding the main folding barrier. Taken together, these experimental and simulation results suggest that the previously characterized fast kinetic phase is not due to formation of a barrier-limited intermediate but rather to a more heterogeneous and slow acquisition of unfolded-state structure.","[Weiss, Shimon] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Dept Physiol, Calif Nanosyst Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Voelz, Vincent A.; Bowman, Gregory R.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jaeger, Marcus] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Yao, Shuhuai] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yujie; Zhu, Li; Waldauer, Steven A.; Lapidus, Lisa J.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhu, Li] Southeast Univ, Adv Photon Ctr, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Friedrichs, Mark] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bakajin, Olgica] Univ Calif Davis, NSF Ctr Biophoton Sci & Technol, Sacramento, CA 95817 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol Struct, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Weiss, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Dept Physiol, Calif Nanosyst Inst, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",sweiss@chem.ucla.edu; pande@stanford.edu,"Zhu, Li/H-4746-2011; weiss, shimon/B-4164-2009; Yao, Shuhuai/G-8672-2011; Waldauer, Steven/D-1217-2010","Zhu, Li/0000-0002-6695-3862; weiss, shimon/0000-0002-0720-5426; Yao, Shuhuai/0000-0001-7059-4092; Voelz, Vincent/0000-0002-1054-2124","FIBR [EF-0623664]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM062868]; NSF grant IDBR [NSF DBI-0754570]; Burroughs Wellcome FundBurroughs Wellcome Fund; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [W-7405-Eng-48]; LDRD program; NSF FIBRNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0623664]; Berry Foundation; Miller Institute;  [NSF-DMS-0900700];  [NSF-MCB-0954714]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation, FIBR Grant EF-0623664 (all authors), NIH R01-GM062868 (V.S.P.), NSF-DMS-0900700 (V.S.P.), NSF-MCB-0954714 (V.S.P.), and NSF grant IDBR (NSF DBI-0754570) (L.J.L).

Although homology modeling techniques are widely used to produce low-resolution models, refining these models to high resolution has proven difficult. With long enough simulations and sufficiently accurate force fields, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle allow such refinement, but efforts to refine homology models using MD have for the most part yielded disappointing results. It has thus far been unclear whether MD-based refinement is limited primarily by accessible simulation timescales, force field accuracy, or both. Here, we examine MD as a technique for homology model refinement using all-atom simulations, each at least 100 mu s longmore than 100 times longer than previous refinement simulationsand a physics-based force field that was recently shown to successfully fold a structurally diverse set of fast-folding proteins. In MD simulations of 24 proteins chosen from the refinement category of recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, we find that in most cases, simulations initiated from homology models drift away from the native structure. Comparison with simulations initiated from the native structure suggests that force field accuracy is the primary factor limiting MD-based refinement. This problem can be mitigated to some extent by restricting sampling to the neighborhood of the initial model, leading to structural improvement that, while limited, is roughly comparable to the leading alternative methods.

Here we study the NNQQ peptide, known to display parallel beta-strands in amyloid fibrils by x-ray microcrystallography, and investigate the structural, thermodynamical, and dynamical properties of 20 NNQQ peptides using molecular dynamics and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations coupled to a coarse-grained force field. All simulations are initiated from randomized and fully dispersed monomeric conformations. Our simulations reveal that the phase transition is characterized by a change in the oligomer and beta-sheet size distributions and the percentage of mixed parallel/antiparallel beta-strands when the sheets are formed. At all temperatures, however, the fraction of parallel beta-strands remains low, though there are many association/fragmentation events. This work and a growing body of computational studies provide strong evidence that the critical nucleus goes beyond 20 chains and reordering of the beta-strands occurs in larger oligomers.

In this review, we discuss (1) the development of the energy landscape theory of biomolecular folding, (2) recent advances toward establishing a consistent understanding of folding and function and (3) emerging themes in the functional motions of enzymes, biomolecular motors and other biomolecular machines. Recent theoretical, computational and experimental lines of investigation have provided a very dynamic picture of biomolecular motion. In contrast to earlier ideas, where molecular machines were thought to function similarly to macroscopic machines, with rigid components that move along a few degrees of freedom in a deterministic fashion, biomolecular complexes are only marginally stable. Since the stabilizing contribution of each atomic interaction is on the order of the thermal fluctuations in solution, the rigid body description of molecular function must be revisited. An emerging theme is that functional motions encompass order-disorder transitions and structural flexibility provides significant contributions to the free energy. In this review, we describe the biological importance of order-disorder transitions and discuss the statistical-mechanical foundation of theoretical approaches that can characterize such transitions.","[Whitford, Paul C.; Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Sanbonmatsu, Karissa Y.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Theoret Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Whitford, PC (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Dept Phys, 6100 Main, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",,,,"Center for Theoretical Biological Physics; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-0822283]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM072686]; Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas;  [NSF-MCB-1214457]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686, R01GM072686] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","PCW would like to thank Professor Alexander Schug (Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie) and Dr Jeffrey Noel (UCSD) for critical feedback during manuscript preparation.

Results show that H-bonded hydrogens are protected from exchange, with HX rate effectively zero, even when they are directly adjacent to solvent. The transition to exchange competence requires a dynamic structural excursion that removes H-bond protection and allows exposure to solvent HX catalyst. The detailed data often make clear the nature of the dynamic excursion required. These range from whole molecule unfolding, through smaller cooperative unfolding reactions of secondary structural elements, and down to local fluctuations that involve as little as a single peptide group or side chain or water molecule. The particular motion that dominates the exchange of any hydrogen is the one that allows the fastest HX rate.

We report here the application of microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent for the improvement of the quality of low-resolution structures obtained by protein structure prediction (decoys). Seventy MD simulations of similar to 1 mu s average duration were performed on 13 different protein systems starting from X-ray crystal structures and decoys. Their behavior can be divided into three groups: 22 trajectories converged toward the native state, 27 trajectories displayed a quasi-equilibrium by populating mainly a single non-native free energy basin, and 21 trajectories drifted away from their initial decoy structure transiently visiting multiple free energy minima. To determine whether the native structure can be identified among non-native ensembles, the free energy was determined for each basin by the MM/GBSA method together with the von Mises entropy estimator in dihedral angle space. For the proteins studied here, it is found that the ensembles belonging to free energy basins with the lowest free energies and the longest residence times are most native-like. The results demonstrate that explicit solvent microsecond MD simulations using the latest generation of protein force fields and free energy metrics are sufficiently accurate to permit positive identification of native state ensembles against low-resolution structural models and decoys. The approach can be applied to the direct refinement of predicted or experimental low-resolution protein structures.","[Brueschweiler, Rafael] Florida State Univ, Chem Sci Lab, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; Florida State Univ, Natl High Magnet Field Lab, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA","Bruschweiler, R (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Chem Sci Lab, Dept Chem & Biochem, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",Bruschweiler@magnet.fsu.edu,"Bruschweiler, Rafael/F-6624-2015; Dawei, Li/F-7233-2010","Dawei, Li/0000-0002-3266-5272",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0918362],This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant MCB-0918362).,,61,5,5,0,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

A key question concerns the nature of their binding mechanism, and whether the bound structure is induced only by proximity to the binding partner. This is difficult to answer through experiment alone because of the very heterogeneous nature of the unbound ensemble, and the probable rapid interconversion of the various unbound structures. Here we report the most extensive set of simulations on NCBD to date: we use large-scale replica exchange molecular dynamics to explore the unbound state. An important feature of the study is the use of an atomistic force field that has been parametrised against experimental data for weakly structured peptides, together with an accurate explicit water model. Neither the force field nor the starting conformations are biased towards a particular structure. The regions of NCBD that have high helical propensity in the simulations correspond closely to helices in the 'core' unbound conformation determined by NMR, although no single member of the simulated unbound ensemble closely resembles the core conformation, or either of the two known bound conformations. We have validated the results against NMR spectroscopy and SAXS measurements, obtaining reasonable agreement. The two helices which most stabilise the binding of NCBD with ACTR are formed readily; the third helix, which is less important for binding but is involved in most of the intraprotein contacts of NCBD in the bound conformation, is formed more rarely, and tends not to coexist with the other helices. These results support a mechanism by which NCBD gains the advantages of disorder, while forming binding-competent structures in the unbound state. We obtain support for this mechanism from coarse-grained simulations of NCBD with, and without, its binding partner.","[Knott, Michael; Best, Robert B.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Knott, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",rbb24@cam.ac.uk,"Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543",Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London; BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H006885/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/H006885/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"RBB is supported by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship.

In CH-REMD, the interaction between the protein and its environment, specifically, the electrostatic interaction between the protein and the solvating water, is varied leading to cycles of partial unfolding and refolding mimicking some aspects of folding chaperones. In 10 of the 15 cases examined, the CH-REMD approach sampled structures in which the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of secondary structure elements (SSE-RMSD) with respect to the experimental structure was more than 1.0 angstrom lower than the initial de novo model. In 14 of the 15 cases, the improvement was more than 0.5 angstrom. The ability of three different statistical potentials to identify near-native conformations was also examined. Little correlation between the SSE-RMSD of the sampled structures with respect to the experimental structure and any of the scoring functions tested was found. The most effective scoring function tested was the DFIRE potential. Using the DFIRE potential, the SSE-RMSD of the best scoring structures was on average 0.3 angstrom lower than the initial model. Overall the work demonstrates that targeted enhanced-sampling techniques such as CH-REMD can lead to the systematic refinement of protein structural models generated de novo but that improved potentials for the identification of near-native structures are still needed.

In the past, the effect of these approximations on macromolecular structure and stability has been evaluated mostly through quantitative studies of small-molecule systems or qualitative observations of short-timescale simulations of biological macromolecules. Here we present a quantitative evaluation of two commonly employed approximations, using a test system that has been the subject of a number of previous protein folding studies-the villin headpiece. In particular, we examined the effect of (i) the use of a cutoff-based force-shifting technique rather than an Ewald summation for the treatment of electrostatic interactions, and (ii) the length of the cutoff used to determine how many pairwise interactions are included in the calculation of both electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Our results show that the free energy of folding is relatively insensitive to the choice of cutoff beyond 9 angstrom, and to whether an Ewald method is used to account for long-range electrostatic interactions. In contrast, we find that the structural properties of the unfolded state depend more strongly on the two approximations examined here.","[Piana, Stefano; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten; Dirks, Robert M.; Salmon, John K.; Dror, Ron O.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY USA","Piana, S (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039",D.E.

Here, we examine the latter for, as an initial candidate, a small de novo beta-hairpin using extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for crowder volume fractions phi up to 40%. We find that crowding does not introduce new folding intermediates or misfolded structures, although, as expected, it promotes compact structures and reduces the accessible conformational space. Furthermore, while hydrophobic-collapse-mediated folding is slightly enhanced, the turn-directed zipper mechanism (dominant in crowder-free situations) increases many-fold, becoming even more dominant. Interestingly, phi influences the stability of the folding intermediates (FI1 and FI2) in an apparently counterintuitive manner, which can be understood only by considering specific intrachain interactions and intermediate (and hierarchical) structural transitions. For phi values <20%, native-turn formation is enhanced, and FI1, characterized by a hairpin structure but slightly mismatched hydrophobic contacts, increases in frequency, thus enhancing eventual folding. However, higher phi values impede native-turn formation, and FI2, which lacks native turns, re-emerges and increasingly acts as a kinetic trap. The change in the stability of these intermediates with phi strongly correlates with the hierarchical folding stages and their kinetics. The results show that crowding assists intermediate structural changes more by impeding backward transitions than by promoting forward transitions and that a delicate competition between reduction in configuration space and introduction of kinetic traps along the folding route is key to understanding folding kinetics under crowded conditions.","[Kurniawan, Nicholas A.; Enemark, Soren; Rajagopalan, Raj] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore MIT Alliance, Singapore 117576, Singapore","Rajagopalan, R (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore MIT Alliance, Singapore 117576, Singapore.",raj@nus.edu.sg,,,Singapore-MIT Alliance,We thank Singapore-MIT Alliance for financial support.,,45,16,16,0,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

We show that the MTM is a mean field-like model that implicitly takes into account denaturant-induced many body interactions. The MTM in conjunction with the coarse-grained self organized polymer model with side chains (SOP-SC) for polypeptide chains is used to simulate the folding of the src-SH3 domain as a function of temperature (T) and guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) concentration [C]. Besides reproducing the thermodynamic aspects of SH3 folding, the SOP-SC also captures the cooperativity of the folding transitions. A number of experimentally testable predictions are also made. First, we predict that the melting temperature T-m([C]) decreases linearly as [C] increases. Second, we show that the midpoints C-m,C-i and melting temperatures T-m,T-i at which individual residues acquire 50% of their native contacts differ from the global midpoint (C-m approximate to 2.5 M) and melting temperature (T-m = 355 K) at which the folded and unfolded states coexist. Dispersion in C-m,C-i is greater than that found for T-m,T-i. Third, folding kinetics at [C] = 0 M shows that the acquisition of contacts between all the secondary structural elements and global folding occur nearly simultaneously. Finally, from the free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap function and the radius of gyration of the protein, we find that at a fixed T the transition state moves toward the folded state as [C] increases in accord with the Hammond postulate. In contrast, we predict that along the locus of points T-m([C]) the location of the transition state does not change. The theory and the models used here are sufficiently general for studying the folding of other single domain proteins.","[Reddy, Govardhan; Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, Biophys Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Thirumalai, D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liu, Zhenxing] Beijing Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Reddy, G (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, Biophys Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",greddy1@umd.edu,"Reddy, Govardhan/D-4427-2011",,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 14-09433]; National Natural Science Foundation of China NNSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11104015],"We thank Edward P.

Partial (at T = 305 K) and complete (at T = 313 K) melting of the N-terminal alpha-helix is observed, manifested by the appearance of minor sets of signals in NMR spectra. Our key findings are: (i) conformational phase transition (melting point) could be described as a cooperative breaking of the Trp6-Pro12 long-range hydrophobic interaction and the melting of the N-terminal alpha-helix; (ii) many ROE signals corresponding to local or short-range interactions vanish rapidly with temperature increase; however, long-range interaction such as Trp6-Arg16 remains until 313 K.

Properly designed coarse-grained models that trade atomic resolution for efficient sampling allow access to much longer time-scales. In-depth understanding of the structural dynamics, however, must involve atomic details. In this study, we tested a method for the rapid reconstruction of all-atom models from a carbon atom positions in the application to convert a coarse-grained folding trajectory of a well described model system: the B domain of protein A. The results show that the method and the spatial resolution of the resulting coarse-grained models enable computationally inexpensive reconstruction of realistic all-atom models. Additionally, by means of structural clustering, we determined the most persistent ensembles of the key folding step, the transition state. Importantly, the analysis of the overall structural topologies suggests a dominant folding pathway. This, together with the all-atom characterization of the obtained ensembles, in the form of contact maps, matches the experimental results well.","[Kmiecik, Sebastian; Gront, Dominik; Kouza, Maksim; Kolinski, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Fac Chem, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland","Kmiecik, S (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Chem, Pasteura 1, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland.",sekmi@chem.uw.edu.pl; kolinski@chem.uw.edu.pl,"Kouza, Maksim/L-9503-2015","Kouza, Maksim/0000-0002-1704-9797",Foundation for Polish Science TEAM project [TEAM/2011-7/6]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU),This paper is dedicated to Professor Harold A Scheraga on the occasion of his 90th birthday.
