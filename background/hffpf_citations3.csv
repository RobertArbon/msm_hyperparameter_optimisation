Properly designed coarse-grained models that trade atomic resolution for efficient sampling allow access to much longer time-scales. In-depth understanding of the structural dynamics, however, must involve atomic details. In this study, we tested a method for the rapid reconstruction of all-atom models from a carbon atom positions in the application to convert a coarse-grained folding trajectory of a well described model system: the B domain of protein A. The results show that the method and the spatial resolution of the resulting coarse-grained models enable computationally inexpensive reconstruction of realistic all-atom models. Additionally, by means of structural clustering, we determined the most persistent ensembles of the key folding step, the transition state. Importantly, the analysis of the overall structural topologies suggests a dominant folding pathway. This, together with the all-atom characterization of the obtained ensembles, in the form of contact maps, matches the experimental results well.","[Kmiecik, Sebastian; Gront, Dominik; Kouza, Maksim; Kolinski, Andrzej] Univ Warsaw, Fac Chem, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland","Kmiecik, S (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Chem, Pasteura 1, PL-02093 Warsaw, Poland.",sekmi@chem.uw.edu.pl; kolinski@chem.uw.edu.pl,"Kouza, Maksim/L-9503-2015","Kouza, Maksim/0000-0002-1704-9797",Foundation for Polish Science TEAM project [TEAM/2011-7/6]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU),This paper is dedicated to Professor Harold A Scheraga on the occasion of his 90th birthday.

Starting from microscopic physics, and with no free parameters, this model predicts that protein folding occurs remarkably quickly because native-like states are kinetic hubs. A hub-like network arises naturally out of microscopic physical concerns, specifically the kinetic longevity of native contacts during a search of lobular conformations. The model predicts folding times scaling as tau(f) similar to e(xi N) in the number of residues, but because the model shows xi is small, the folding times are much faster than Levinthal's approximation. Importantly, the folding time scale is found to be small due to the topology and structure of the network. We show explicitly how our model agrees with generic experimental features of the folding process, including the scaling of tau(f) with N, two-state thermodynamics, a sharp peak in C-V, and native-state fluctuations.","[Lane, Thomas J.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,"Lane, Thomas/0000-0003-2627-4432","NSF GRFNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0954714]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM062868]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The history and literature of protein folding is extensive.

Here, the effect of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on the folding of the SH3 domain of PI3 kinase was investigated in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) using intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) binding. The free energy of unfolding in water of the native state (N) increases linearly with Na2SO4 concentration, indicating stabilization via the Hofmeister effect. The addition of 0.5 M Na2SO4 causes accumulation of an early intermediate L, which manifests itself as (1) a sub-millisecond change in tyrosine and ANS fluorescence and (2) a curvature in the chevron plot. It is shown that L is a specific structural component of the initially collapsed ensemble. An intermediate, M, also accumulates in unfolding studies conducted in the presence of 0.5 M Na2SO4 and manifests itself by causing a curvature in the unfolding arm of the chevron. M is shown to be a wet molten globule that binds to ANS under unfolding conditions and is stabilized to the same extent as N in the presence of Na2SO4. A four-state U <-> L <-> M <-> N scheme satisfactorily modeled the kinetic data. Thus, the folding of the PI3K SH3 domain in the presence of salt commences via the formation of a structured intermediate ensemble L, which accumulates before the rate-limiting step of folding. L subsequently proceeds to N via the late intermediate M that forms after the rate-limiting transition of folding.","[Dasgupta, Amrita; Udgaonkar, Jayant B.] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India","Udgaonkar, JB (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.",jayant@ncbs.res.in,,,"Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchTata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Department of Science and Technology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Government of India","This work was funded by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

Using the cut-based free energy profile and Markov state models, FEGS speeds up sampling of the canonical ensemble by iteratively restarting multiple short simulations in parallel from regions of the free energy surface visited rarely. This exploration stage is followed by a refinement stage in which multiple independent runs are initiated from Boltzmann distributed conformations. Notably, FEGS does not require either collective variables or reaction coordinates and can control the kinetic distance from the starting conformation. We applied FEGS to the alanine dipeptide, which has a human-comprehensible two-dimensional free energy landscape, and a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet peptide of 20 residues whose folding/unfolding process is governed by a delicate interplay of enthalpy and entropy. For these two systems, FEGS speeds up the exploration of conformational space by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude with respect to conventional sampling and preserves the basins and barriers on the free energy profile.","[Zhou, Ting; Caflisch, Amedeo] Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland","Caflisch, A (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Biochem, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.",caflisch@bioc.uzh.ch,"Caflisch, Amedeo/I-3459-2012",,,,,52,17,17,0,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

E2s are multi-domain proteins, with accessory N-terminal or C-terminal domains that can contribute to the specificity for the cognate Ub-like molecules, or even the E3. In this context, the thorough structural characterization of E2 accessory domains is mandatory, in particular when they are associated to specific functions. We here provide, by computational and comparative studies, the first evidence of an acidic domain (AD) conserved in the E2 sub-family 3R. It is an intrinsically disordered domain, in which elements for Ub or E3 recognition are maintained. This conserved acidic domain (AD) shows propensity for a-helix structures (185-192 and 204-218) in the proximity of the sites for interaction with the Ub or the cognate E3. Moreover, our results also suggest that AD can explore conformations with tertiary contacts mainly driven by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions, in absence of its interaction partners. The globular states are likely to be regulated by multiple phosphorylation events, which can trigger conformational changes toward more extended conformations, as judged by MD simulations of the phospho-variants. The extended conformations, in turn, promote the accessibility of the interaction sites for Ub and the E3. We also trace a parallel between this new and natively unfolded structural motif for Ub-recognition and the natively folded ubiquitin associated domain (UBA) typical of family 1 of E2 enzymes, which includes Ubc1. In fact, according to our calculations. Ubc1 maps at the interface between the space of the natively unfolded and folded proteins, as well as it shares common features with the acidic domain of family 3 members. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A synthetic dichloroacetone crosslink is first introduced across two beta strands. Whether the structural content in the transition state ensemble has shifted towards the region containing the crosslink is probed by remeasuring the Psi value at another region (Psi identifies the degree to which an inserted bi-Histidine metal ion binding site is formed in the transition state). For sites around the periphery of the obligate transition state nucleus, we find that the resulting changes in Psi values are near or at our detection limit, thereby indicating that the structural content of the transition state has not measurably changed upon crosslinking.

The rationale is to develop sensors with expanded dynamic range and faster response time by coupling a given signal to the continuous (rather than binary) unfolding process of one-state downhill folding protein modules. As proof of concept we investigate the pH and ionic-strength sensing capabilities of the small a-helical protein BBL. Our results reveal that such a pH/ionic-strength sensor exhibits a linear response over 4 orders of magnitude in analyte concentration, compared to the 2 orders of magnitude for switches, and nearly concentration-independent microsecond response times.","[Cerminara, Michele; Desai, Tanay M.; Sadqi, Mourad; Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Desai, Tanay M.; Munoz, Victor] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, Madrid 28040, Spain.",vmunoz@cib.csic.es,"Sadqi, Mourad/J-3180-2018","Sadqi, Mourad/0000-0003-3553-3408","Marie Curie Excellence GrantEuropean Union (EU) [MEXT-CT-2006-042334]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [BFU2008-03237, CONSOLIDER CSD2009-00088]","This work was supported by the Marie Curie Excellence Grant MEXT-CT-2006-042334, and grants BFU2008-03237 and CONSOLIDER CSD2009-00088 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.",,29,16,16,0,31,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,1520-5126,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

CDD can be even more crucial in downhill folding without thermodynamic barriers. We explored the CDD of a downhill protein (BBL), and a two-state protein (CI2). The hidden kinetic barriers due to CDD were revealed. The increased similar to 1 k(B)T kinetic barrier is in line with experimental value based on other fast folding proteins. Compared to that of CI2, the effective free-energy profile of BBL is found to be significantly influenced by CDD, and the kinetics are totally determined by diffusion. These findings are consistent with both earlier bulk and single-molecule fluorescence measurements. In addition, we found the temperature dependence of CDD. We also found that the ratio of folding transition temperature against optimal kinetic folding temperature can provide both a quantitative measure for the underlying landscape topography and an indicator for the possible appearance of downhill folding. Our study can help for a better understanding of the role of diffusion in protein folding dynamics.","[Xu, Weixin; Lai, Zaizhi; Wang, Jin] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Xu, Weixin; Lai, Zaizhi; Wang, Jin] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Phys, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Xu, Weixin] E China Normal Univ, Dept Phys, State Key Lab Precis Spect, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Xu, Weixin] E China Normal Univ, Inst Theoret & Computat Sci, Inst Adv Interdisciplinary Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Oliveira, Ronaldo J.; Leite, Vitor B.

A length of 80 amino acid residues puts it on the large end among all known microsecond folders, and its size poses a computational challenge for molecular dynamics (MD) studies. We simulated the folding of a novel lambda-repressor fast-folding mutant (lambda-HG) in explicit solvent using an all-atom description. By means of a recently developed tempering method, we observed reversible folding and unfolding of lambda-repressor in a 10 mu s trajectory. The folding kinetics was also investigated through a set of MD simulations run at different temperatures that together covered more than 125 mu s. The protein was seen to fold into a native-like topology at intermediate temperature, and a slow-folding pathway was identified. The simulations suggest new experimental observables for better monitoring of the folding process, and a novel mutation is expected to accelerate lambda-repressor folding.","[Liu, Yanxin; Struempfer,

The data suggested four relaxation phases, two fast phases at shorter times of 1-10 s (tau(1) and tau(2)) and two slow phases with longer times of approximate to 50-450 s (tau(3) and tau(4)). The stresses were mainly correlated with kernel mechanical properties. There were differences in spring and stress elements of Glu-A1 null compared to Glu-A1 1 and 2*. The Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 showed differences in the stresses. Glu-A3 only affected kernel mechanical properties while Glu-B3 showed differences in both quality parameters and mechanical properties. The relaxation times tau(3) were high for genotypes with high SDS-sedimentation volume and long mixing time. Genotypes with 45-60 s of tau(3) usually had good HMW-GS background and LMW allelic combination generally associated with good quality. As expected, genotypes with short relaxation and mixing times and poor sedimentation volume were samples with Glu-A1 null, Glu-B3 j 1B/1R, and with Glu-A3 e (null). Differences in stress relaxation were found among HMW-GS and LMW-GS alleles specially Glu-3 loci and the differences were related to SDS-sedimentation, mixing and alveograph data.

However, purposeful perturbation of biological systems can provide much information about their dynamics, robustness, and function. Such perturbations are particularly easy to apply at the interface of molecular biophysics and cellular biology, at which complex and highly regulated networks emerge from the behavior of individual biomolecules. Due to the size of diffusion coefficients and the length scale of biomolecules, the fastest timescales at this interface extend to below a microsecond. Thus perturbations must be induced and detected rapidly. We focus on examples of proteins and RNAs interacting with themselves (folding) or one another (binding, signaling). Beginning with general principles that have been learned from simple models and perturbation experiments in vitro, we progress to more complex environments that mimic aspects of the living cell, and finally rapid perturbation experiments in living cells. On the experimental side we highlight in particular two classes of rapid perturbation methods (nanoseconds to seconds) that have been traditionally employed in biophysical chemistry, but that will become increasingly important in cell biology and in vivo: fast relaxation techniques and phase-sensitive modulation techniques. These techniques are now increasingly married with imaging to produce a spatiotemporal map of biomolecular stability, dynamics and, in the near future, interaction networks inside cells. Many important chemical processes occur on biologically fast timescales, and yet have important ramifications for slower biological networks.","[Gelman, Hannah; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Platkov, Max; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Platkov, Max; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Gruebele, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mgruebel@illinois.edu,,,NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1019958]; NSF Center for the Physics of Living Cells; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1019958] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We wish to thank Taras Pogorelov, Sharlene Denos, Apratim Dhar, Simon Ebbinghaus, and Minghao Guo for providing help with the figures and data discussed here and Robert Clegg for helpful discussion.

If water is considered implicitly (as media rather than as molecules), calculations become faster. These calculations are less precise, unless one uses voluminous computations of solvent-accessible areas. Our goal is to obtain parameters for nonbonded atom-atom interactions in implicitly considered water without computation of solvent-accessible areas. Because the in-vacuum interactions of atoms are obtained from experimental structures of crystals and enthalpies of their sublimation, the in-water interactions must be corrected using solvation free energies obtained from Henry's constants. Thus, we obtained parameters for the in-water van der Waals, electrostatic, and polarized interactions for atoms typical of protein structures. Parameters of covalent interactions were taken from the ENCAD force field and partial charges of atoms from quantum-mechanical calculations. The sought parameters of the in-water nonbonded interactions were optimized to achieve the best description of crystal structures and their sublimation and solvation at the room temperature. With the optimized parameters, the correlation between the calculated and experimental cohesion of molecules in crystals is 98.3% in the in-vacuum case (the supplementary force field PFFSubl1.1) and 95.4% the in-water case (the sought force field PFFSol1.1).","[Pereyaslavets, Leonid B.; Finkelstein, Alexey V.] Russian Acad Sci, Lab Prot Phys, Inst Prot Res, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia","Finkelstein, AV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Lab Prot Phys, Inst Prot Res, 4 Inst Skaya Str, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia.",afinkel@vega.protres.ru,"Finkelstein, Alexey/M-1440-2015","Finkelstein, Alexey/0000-0002-2138-4803",Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [10-04-00162-a]; Presidium of Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Academy of Sciences [01200957492]; Support of the Leading Scientific Schools [NSh-2791.2008.4]; Federal Agency for Science and InnovationsFederal Agency for Science & Innovations (FASI) [02.740.11.0295]; Algodign LLC (Moscow); Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute [55005607],"We are grateful to M.

Interestingly, we find a misfolded, out-of-register, structure comprising 20-50% of the ordered structures with three force fields, but not with a fourth. A defining feature of the misfold is that Gly-7 adopts a beta(PR) conformation rather than alpha(L). By reweighting, we show that differences between the force fields can mostly be attributed to differences in glycine properties. Benchmarking against NMR data suggests that the preference for beta(PR) is not a force-field artifact. For chignolin, we show that including the misfold in the ensemble results in back-recalculated NMR observables in slightly better agreement with experiment than parameters calculated from a folded ensemble only. For comparison, we show by NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy that the G7K mutant of chignolin, in which formation of this misfold is impossible, is well folded with stability similar to the wild-type and does not populate the misfolded state in simulation. Our results highlight the complexity of interpreting NMR data for small, weakly structured, peptides in solution, as well as the importance of accurate glycine parameters in force fields, for a correct description of turn structures.","[Kuehrova, Petra; Otyepka, Michal] Palacky Univ, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Dept Phys Chem, Fac Sci, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic; [De Simone, Alfonso] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Mol Biosci, London, England; [Best, Robert B.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Best, RB (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Dept Phys Chem, Fac Sci, CR-77147 Olomouc, Czech Republic.",rbb24@cam.ac.uk,"Otyepka, Michal/D-1220-2017; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016; Otyepka, Michal/A-5922-2008","Otyepka, Michal/0000-0002-1066-5677; Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543; ","Palacky University [PrF-2011-020]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [203/09/H046]; HPC-Europa2 Transnational Access Program; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0058, CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0017]; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, United KingdomEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G049998/2] Funding Source: researchfish","P.K. was supported by Student Project PrF-2011-020 of Palacky University, 203/09/H046 from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.

On the basis of the close agreement between the calculated helix contents from AHBC simulations and experimental results, we observed based on the presented simulations that the two ends of the peptide may simultaneously take part in the formation of the helical structure at the early stage of folding and finally merge to form a helix with lowest backbone RMSD of about 0.9 angstrom in 40% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol solution. However, in pure water, the folding may start at the center of the peptide sequence instead of at the two opposite ends. The analysis of the free energy landscape indicates that the solvent may determine the folding clusters of E6ap, which subsequently leads to the different final folded structure. The current study demonstrates new insight to the role of solvent in the determination of protein structure and folding dynamics. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The energy surfaces were expressed in the C-alpha ... C-alpha virtual-bond length (d) and the H-N-C-alpha center dot center dot center dot C' improper dihedral angle (alpha) that describes the pyramidicity of the amide nitrogen, or in the C-alpha-C'(O)-N-C-alpha dihedral angle (omega) and the angle alpha. For each grid point, the potential energy was minimized with respect to all remaining degrees of freedom. The PMFs obtained from the (d,alpha) energy surfaces produced realistic free-energy barriers to the trans-cis transition (10 and 13 kcal/mol for the regular and proline peptide groups, respectively, compared to 12.6-13.9 kcal/mol and 17.3-19.6 kcal/mol determined experimentally for glycylglycine and N-acylprolines, respectively), while those obtained from the (omega,alpha) energy maps produced either low-quality PMF curves when direct Boltzmann summation was implemented to compute the PMFs or too-flat curves with too-low free-energy barriers to the trans-cis transition if harmonic extrapolation was used to estimate the contributions to the partition function. An analytical bimodal logarithmic-Gaussian expression was fitted to the PMFs, and the potentials were implemented in the UNRES force field. Test Langevin-dynamics simulations were carried out for the Gly-Gly and Gly-Pro dipeptides, which showed a 10(6)-fold increase of the simulated rate of the trans-cis isomerization with respect to that measured experimentally; effectively the same result was obtained with the analytical Kramers theory of reaction rate applied to the UNRES representation of the peptide groups. Application of Kramers' theory to the computation of the rate constants from the all-atom ab initio energy surfaces of the model compounds studied resulted in isomerization rates close to the experimental values, which demonstrates that the increase of the isomerization rate in UNRES simulations results solely from averaging out the secondary degrees of freedom.","[Sieradzan, Adam K.; Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland; [Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Liwo, A (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Sobieskiego 18, PL-80952 Gdansk, Poland.",adam@chem.univ.gda.pl,"Sieradzan, Adam/ABC-3552-2020","Sieradzan, Adam/0000-0002-2426-3644; Liwo, Adam/0000-0001-6942-2226","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [538-8372-0510-1]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB10-19767]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grants from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (538-8372-0510-1), the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312), and the National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767).

Our atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of lysozyme in water-DMSO reveal the following sequence of changes on increasing DMSO concentration. (i) At the initial stage (around 5% DMSO concentration) protein's conformational flexibility gets markedly suppressed. From study of radial distribution functions, we attribute this to the preferential solvation of exposed protein hydrophobic residues by the methyl groups of DMSO. (ii) In the next stage (10-15% DMSO concentration range), lysozome partially unfolds accompanied by an increase both in fluctuation and in exposed protein surface area. (iii) Between 15-20% concentration ranges, both conformational fluctuation and solvent accessible protein surface area suddenly decrease again indicating the formation of an intermediate collapse state. These results are in good agreement with near-UV circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence studies. We explain this apparently surprising behavior in terms of a structural transformation which involves clustering among the methyl groups of DMSO. (iv) Beyond 20% concentration of DMSO, the protein starts its final sojourn towards the unfolding state with further increase in conformational fluctuation and loss in native contacts. Most importantly, analysis of contact map and fluctuation near the active site reveal that both partial unfolding and conformational fluctuations are centered mostly on the hydrophobic core of active site of lysozyme. Our results could offer a general explanation and universal picture of the anomalous behavior of protein structure-function observed in the presence of cosolvents (DMSO, ethanol, tertiary butyl alcohol, dioxane) at their low concentrations.

By studying helix formation in molecular simulations of a series of alanine-based peptides, we obtain the temperature-dependent alpha-helix propensities of all 20 naturally occurring residues with two recent additive force fields, Amber ff03w and Amber ff99SB(star). Encouragingly, we find that the overall helix propensity of many residues is captured well by both energy functions, with Amber ff99SB* being more accurate. Nonetheless, there are some residues that deviate considerably from experiment, which can be attributed to two aspects of the energy function: i), variations of the charge model used to determine the atomic partial charges, with residues whose backbone charges differ most from alanine tending to have the largest error; ii), side-chain torsion potentials, as illustrated by the effect of modifications to the torsion angles of I, L, D, N. We find that constrained refitting of residue charges for charged residues in Amber ff99SB(star) significantly improves their helix propensity. The resulting parameters should more faithfully reproduce helix propensities in simulations of protein folding and disordered proteins.","[Best, Robert B.; de Sancho, David] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Mittal, Jeetain] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England.",rbb24@cam.ac.uk; jeetain@lehigh.edu,"De Sancho, David/C-4995-2009; Best, Robert/H-7588-2016","De Sancho, David/0000-0002-8985-2685; Best, Robert/0000-0002-7893-3543",Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London; Federation of European Biochemical Societies; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-1053575],"R.B. is supported by a Royal Society University Research Fellowship and D.D. by a Federation of European Biochemical Societies Long-Term Post-Doctoral Fellowship.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have added considerably to our understanding of folded proteins, but the accuracy with which the force fields used in such simulations can describe disordered proteins is unclear. In this work, using a modern force field, we performed a 200 mu s unrestrained MD simulation of the acid-unfolded state of an experimentally well-characterized protein, ACBP, to explore the extent to which state-of-the-art simulation can describe the structural and dynamical features of a disordered protein. By comparing the simulation results with the results of NMR experiments, we demonstrate that the simulation successfully captures important aspects of both the local and global structure. Our simulation was similar to 2 orders of magnitude longer than those in previous studies of unfolded proteins, a length sufficient to observe repeated formation and breaking of helical structure, which we found to occur on a multimicrosecond time scale. We observed one structural feature that formed but did not break during the simulation, highlighting the difficulty in sampling disordered states. Overall, however, our simulation results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating that MD simulations can already be useful in describing disordered proteins. Finally, our direct calculation of certain NMR observables from the simulation provides new insight into the general relationship between structural features of disordered proteins and experimental NMR relaxation properties.","[Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten; Trbovic, Nikola; Maragakis, Paul; Piana, Stefano; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Trbovic, Nikola] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10032 USA","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Kresten.Lindorff-Larsen@DEShawResearch.com; Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039",,,,27,165,167,1,117,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,1520-5126,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Whereas the folding rate coefficients differ by a factor of 10,000, the transition-path times differ by a factor of less than 5, which shows that a fast- and a slow-folding protein take almost the same time to fold when folding actually happens.

The algorithm provides both posterior samples and an estimate of the evidence (marginal likelihood) of the model. The nested sampling algorithm also provides an efficient way to calculate free energies and the expectation value of thermodynamic observables at any temperature, through a simple post processing of the output. Previous applications of the algorithm have yielded large efficiency gains over other sampling techniques, including parallel tempering. In this article, we describe a parallel implementation of the nested sampling algorithm and its application to the problem of protein folding in a GO-like force field of empirical potentials that were designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in room-temperature simulations. We demonstrate the method by conducting folding simulations on a number of small proteins that are commonly used for testing protein-folding procedures. A topological analysis of the posterior samples is performed to produce energy landscape charts, which give a high-level description of the potential energy surface for the protein folding simulations.

Here we present a systematic and extensive evaluation of eight different protein force fields based on comparisons of experimental data with molecular dynamics simulations that reach a previously inaccessible timescale. First, through extensive comparisons with experimental NMR data, we examined the force fields' abilities to describe the structure and fluctuations of folded proteins. Second, we quantified potential biases towards different secondary structure types by comparing experimental and simulation data for small peptides that preferentially populate either helical or sheet-like structures. Third, we tested the force fields' abilities to fold two small proteins-one alpha-helical, the other with beta-sheet structure. The results suggest that force fields have improved over time, and that the most recent versions, while not perfect, provide an accurate description of many structural and dynamical properties of proteins.","[Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten; Maragakis, Paul; Piana, Stefano; Eastwood, Michael P.; Dror, Ron O.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New York, NY USA","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,"Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014","Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/0000-0002-4750-6039",,,,42,378,380,2,123,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,FEB 22,2012,7,2,,,,,,,e32131,10.1371/journal.pone.0032131,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,926ZZ,WOS:000302875500077,22384157,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",Y,N,2020-11-19,

Characterisation of this species is often difficult since the native state is usually predominantly populated at equilibrium. Previous work has shown that the four-helix protein, Im7 (immunity protein 7), folds via an on-pathway intermediate. While the transition states and folding intermediate have been characterised in atomistic detail, knowledge of the unfolded ensemble under the same ambient conditions remained sparse. Here, we introduce destabilising amino acid substitutions into the sequence of Im7, such that the unfolded state becomes predominantly populated at equilibrium in the absence of denaturant. Using far- and near-UV CD, fluorescence, urea titration and heteronuclear NMR experiments, we show that three amino acid substitutions (L18A-L19A-L37A) are sufficient to prevent Im7 folding, such that the unfolded state is predominantly populated at equilibrium. Using measurement of chemical shifts, N-15 transverse relaxation rates and sedimentation coefficients, we show that the unfolded species of L18-AL19-AL37A deviates significantly from random-coil behaviour. Specifically, we demonstrate that this unfolded species is compact (R-h = 25 angstrom) relative to the urea-denatured state (R-h >= 30 angstrom) and contains local clusters of hydrophobic residues in regions that correspond to the four helices in the native state. Despite these interactions, there is no evidence for long-range stabilising tertiary interactions or persistent helical structure. The results reveal an unfolded ensemble that is conformationally restricted in regions of the polypeptide chain that ultimately form helices I, II and IV in the native state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Atomistic molecular simulations with explicit solvent are the most promising method for providing this information, by accounting more directly for the physical interactions that stabilize proteins. Although simulations of folding with such force fields are extremely challenging, they have become feasible as a result of recent advances in computational power, accuracy of the energy functions or 'force fields', and methods for improving sampling of folding events. I review the recent progress in these areas, and highlight future challenges and questions that we may hope to address with these methods.

Experimental studies of one-state downhill folding have typically focused on the thermal denaturation of proteins that fold near the speed limit (ca. 10(6) s(-1)) at their unfolding temperature, thus being several orders of magnitude too fast for current single-molecule methods, such as single-molecule FRET. An important open question is whether one-state downhill folding kinetics can be slowed down to make them accessible to single-molecule approaches without turning the protein into a conventional activated folder. Here we address this question on the small helical protein BBL, a paradigm of one-state downhill thermal (un)folding. We decreased 200-fold the BBL folding-unfolding rate by combining chemical denaturation and low temperature, and carried out free-diffusion single-molecule FRET experiments with 50-mu s resolution and maximal photoprotection using a recently developed Troloxcysteamine cocktail. These experiments revealed a single conformational ensemble at all denaturing conditions. The chemical unfolding of BBL was then manifested by the gradual change of this unique ensemble, which shifts from high to low FRET efficiency and becomes broader at increasing denaturant. Furthermore, using detailed quantitative analysis, we could rule out the possibility that the BBL single-molecule data are produced by partly overlapping folded and unfolded peaks. Thus, our results demonstrate the one-state downhill folding regime at the single-molecule level and highlight that this folding scenario is not necessarily associated with ultrafast kinetics.","[Liu, Jianwei; Campos, Luis A.; Wang, Xiang; English, Douglas S.; Munoz, Victor] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Campos, Luis A.; Cerminara, Michele; Ramanathan, Ravishankar; Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, E-28040 Madrid, Spain","Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biochem, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",vmunoz@cib.csic.es,"Campos, Luis/A-1865-2019","Campos, Luis/0000-0003-4788-9102; Wang, Xiang/0000-0003-3304-5996","Marie Curie Excellence AwardEuropean Union (EU) [MEXT-CT-2006-042334]; Spanish Ministry of Science and InnovationSpanish Government [BFU2008-03237, CONSOLIDER CSD2009-00088]","This work was supported in part by the Marie Curie Excellence Award MEXT-CT-2006-042334, and Grants BFU2008-03237 and CONSOLIDER CSD2009-00088 from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.",,39,46,46,0,45,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We investigated the stability of lambda(6-85) in two different low-fluorescence crowding matrices: the large 70 kDa carbohydrate Ficoll 70, and the small 14 kDa thermophilic protein SubL. The same thermal stability of secondary structure was measured by circular dichroism in aqueous buffer, and at a crowding fraction phi = 15 +/- 1% of Ficoll 70. Tryptophan fluorescence detection (probing a tertiary contact) yielded the same thermal stability in Ficoll, but 4 degrees C lower in aqueous buffer. Temperature-jump kinetics revealed that the relaxation rate, corrected for bulk viscosity, was very similar in Ficoll and in aqueous buffer. Thus viscosity, hydrodynamics and crowding seem to compensate one another. However, a new fast phase was observed in Ficoll, attributed to crowding-induced downhill folding. We also measured the stability of lambda(6-85) in phi = 14 +/- 1% SubL, which acts as a smaller more rigid crowder. Significantly greater stabilization (7 to 13 degrees C depending on probe) was observed than in the Ficoll matrix. The results highlight the importance of crowding agent choice for studies of small, fast-folding proteins amenable to comparison with molecular dynamics simulations.","[Denos, Sharlene; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dhar, Apratim; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Gruebele, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, 600 S Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mgruebel@illinois.edu,,,"US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1019958]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, R01GM093318] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by US National Science Foundation grant MCB 1019958.
