The highest variability and diversity of an antibody is concentrated on six hypervariable loops, also known as complementarity determining regions (CDRs) shaping the antigen-binding site, the paratope. Whereas it was assumed that certain sequences can only adopt a limited set of backbone conformations, in this study we present a kinetic classification of several paratope states in solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with experimental structural information we capture the involved conformational transitions between different canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures occurring in the micro-to-millisecond timescale. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation of CDR loop movements. Another important aspect when characterizing different paratope states is the relative V-H/V-L orientation and the influence of the distinct CDR loop states on the V-H/V-L interface. Conformational rearrangements of the CDR loops do not only have an effect on the relative V-H/V-L orientations, but also influence in some cases the elbow-angle dynamics and shift the respective distributions. Thus, our results show that antibodies exist as several interconverting paratope states, each contributing to the antibody's properties. Fernandez-Quintero et al. employ molecular dynamics simulations in combination with experimental structural information to demonstrate that antibodies exist as several interconverting paratope states. They propose that dynamic conformational transitions on the micro-to-millisecond timescale are responsible for antibody allostery in contrast to the long believed paradigm of static canonical structures determining binding properties and specificity of antibodies.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Pomarici, Nancy D.; Math, Barbara A.; Kroell, Katharina B.; Waibl, Franz; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Pomarici, Nancy D.; Math, Barbara A.; Kroell, Katharina B.; Waibl, Franz; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Bujotzek, Alexander; Georges, Guy] Roche Innovat Ctr Munich, Large Mol Res, Roche Pharma Res & Early Dev, Penzberg, Germany","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30402, DOC30 P31434]","This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grants P30565, P30402 and DOC30 P31434.",,86,0,0,0,0,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",,2399-3642,,COMMUN BIOL,Commun.

Recent NMR relaxation experiments revealed the transient presence of an alternative, Hoogsteen (HG) base pairing pattern in naked DNA duplexes, and estimated its relative stability and lifetime. In contrast with DNA, such structures were not observed in RNA duplexes. Understanding HG base pairing is important because the underlying breathing motion between the two conformations can significantly modulate protein binding. However, a detailed mechanistic insight into the transition pathways and kinetics is still missing. We performed enhanced sampling simulation (with combined metadynamics and adaptive force-bias method) and Markov state modeling to obtain accurate free energy, kinetics, and the intermediates in the transition pathway between Watson-Crick and HG base pairs for both naked B-DNA and A-RNA duplexes. The Markov state model constructed from our unbiased MD simulation data revealed previously unknown complex extrahelical intermediates in the seemingly simple process of base flipping in B-DNA. Extending our calculation to A-RNA, for which HG base pairing is not observed experimentally, resulted in relatively unstable, single-hydrogenbonded, distorted Hoogsteen-like bases. Unlike B-DNA, the transition pathway primarily involved base paired and intrahelical intermediates with transition timescales much longer than that of B-DNA. The seemingly obvious flip-over reaction coordinate (i.e., the glycosidic torsion angle) is unable to resolve the intermediates. Instead, a multidimensional picture involving back-bone dihedral angles and distance between hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms is required to gain insight into the molecular mechanism.","[Ray, Dhiman; Andricioaei, Ioan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Andricioaei, Ioan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Andricioaei, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.; Andricioaei, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Phys & Astron, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",andricio@uci.edu,,,National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RO1GM089846-08],"The authors thank James McSally for help in building the initial structures of DNA and RNA.

Here we show that recurrent networks, specifically long short-term memory networks can also capture the temporal evolution of chemical/biophysical trajectories. Our character-level language model learns a probabilistic model of 1-dimensional stochastic trajectories generated from higher-dimensional dynamics. The model captures Boltzmann statistics and also reproduces kinetics across a spectrum of timescales. We demonstrate how training the long short-term memory network is equivalent to learning a path entropy, and that its embedding layer, instead of representing contextual meaning of characters, here exhibits a nontrivial connectivity between different metastable states in the underlying physical system. We demonstrate our model's reliability through different benchmark systems and a force spectroscopy trajectory for multi-state riboswitch. We anticipate that our work represents a stepping stone in the understanding and use of recurrent neural networks for understanding the dynamics of complex stochastic molecular systems. Artificial neural networks have been successfully used for language recognition.

However, influenza viruses can rapidly escape antibody recognition by mutation of hypervariable regions of HA that overlap with the binding epitope. We hypothesized that by designing peptides to mimic antibody loops, we could enhance breadth of binding to HA antigenic variants by reducing contact with hypervariable residues on HA that mediate escape. We designed cyclic peptides that mimic the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) of anti-influenza broadly neutralizing antibody C05 and show that these peptides bound to HA molecules with <100 nM affinity, comparable with that of the full-length parental C05 IgG. In addition, these peptides exhibited increased breadth of recognition to influenza H4 and H7 subtypes by eliminating clashes between the hypervariable antigenic regions and the antibody CDRH1 loop. This approach can be used to generate antibody-derived peptides against a wide variety of targets.","[Sevy, Alexander M.; Brown, Benjamin P.; Meiler, Jens; Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Chem & Phys Biol Program, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Sevy, Alexander M.; Brown, Benjamin P.; Bozhanova, Nina G.; Meiler, Jens] Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Sevy, Alexander M.; Gilchuk, Iuliia M.; Nargi, Rachel; Jensen, Mattie; Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Vaccine Ctr, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Bozhanova, Nina G.; Meiler, Jens] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Crowe, James E., Jr.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA","Meiler, J; Crowe, JE (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Chem & Phys Biol Program, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.; Meiler, J (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Ctr Struct Biol, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.; Crowe, JE (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Vanderbilt Vaccine Ctr, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.; Meiler, J (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Chem, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.; Crowe, JE (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.",jens.meiler@vanderbilt.edu; james.crowe@vanderbilt.edu,"Crowe, James/B-5549-2009","Crowe, James/0000-0002-0049-1079; Bozhanova, Nina/0000-0002-2164-5698; Brown, Benjamin/0000-0001-5296-087X","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U19 AI117905, HHSN272201400024C, R01 AI141661, R21 AI21799]","This work was supported by NIH grant U19 AI117905 and NIH contract HHSN272201400024C.

Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of beta-arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different MOR active conformations from those stabilized by classic opioid drugs or G protein-biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of MOR and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes are unknown. Here, we report the results of submillisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics simulations of a predicted methadone-bound MOR complex and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classic opioid morphine and the G protein-biased ligand TRV130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov state models and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of MOR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintenance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not as widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction. In particular, we present details of a methadone-specific active conformation of the mu-opioid receptor that has thus far eluded experimental structural characterization.","[Kapoor, Abhijeet; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, One Gustave L Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029 USA","Filizola, M (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, One Gustave L Levy Pl, New York, NY 10029 USA.",marta.filizola@mssm.edu,,"kapoor, Abhijeet/0000-0002-3606-3463","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA045473]; Office of Research Infrastructure of the National Institutes of Health [S10OD018522, S10OD026880]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB080077, ACI-1548562]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through the National Institutes of Health National Institute of General Medical Sciences [R01-GM116961]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [Grant DA045473].

The structure-permeability relationship of these cyclic depsipeptides that could ultimately provide insights into the compound bioavailability is not yet well understood. The fullyN-methylated amide backbone and apolar sidechain residues do not allow for the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, normally observed in the membrane-permeable conformations of cyclic peptides. Hence, any understanding gained on these depsipeptides would serve as a prototype for future design strategies. In previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies, two macrocyclic core conformers of emodepside were detected, one with all backbone amides intrans-configuration (hereon referred as the symmetric conformer) and the other with one amide incis-configuration (hereon referred as the asymmetric conformer). In addition, these depsipeptides were also reported to be ionophores with a preference of potassium over sodium. In this study, we relate the conformational behavior of PF1022A, emodepside, and closely related analogs with their ionophoric characteristic probed using NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finally evaluated their passive membrane permeability using PAMPA. We find that the equilibrium between the two core conformers shifts more towards the symmetric conformer upon addition of monovalent cations with selectivity for potassium over sodium. Both the NMR experiments and the theoretical Markov state models based on extensive MD simulations indicate a more rigid backbone for the asymmetric conformation, whereas the symmetric conformation shows greater flexibility. The experimental results further advocate for the symmetric conformation binding the cation. The PAMPA results suggest that the investigated depsipeptides are retained in the membrane, which may be advantageous for the likely target, a membrane-bound potassium channel.","[Stadelmann, Thomas; Ebert, Marc-Olivier; Riniker, Sereina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1-5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Subramanian, Govindan; Menon, Sanjay] Zoetis, Vet Med Res & Dev, 333 Portage St,Bldg 300, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA; [Townsend, Chad E.; Lokey, R.

The underlying folding landscape potentially has many minima separated by high free-energy barriers. However, using current theoretical models to characterize this complex folding landscape has remained a challenging problem. In this study, by developing a hybrid atomistic structure-based model that merges structural information on the hybrid-1, hybrid-2, and chair-type G-quadruplex topologies, we investigated a kinetic partitioning folding process of human telomeric DNA involving three native folds. The model was validated as it reproduced the experimental observation that the hybrid-1 conformation is the major fold and the hybrid-2 conformation is kinetically more accessible. A three-step mechanism was revealed for the formation of the hybrid-1 conformation, while a two-step mechanism was demonstrated for the formation of hybrid-2 and chair-type conformations. Likewise, a class of state in which structures adopted inappropriate combinations of syn/anti guanine nucleotides was found to greatly slow down the folding process. In addition, by employing the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, three interatom distances and six dihedral angles were identified as essential internal coordinates to represent the low-dimensional folding landscape. The strategy of coupling the multibasin model and the machine learning algorithm may be useful to investigate the conformational dynamics of other multistate biomolecules.","[Bian, Yunqiang; Song, Feng; Yu, Jiafeng; Wang, Jihua] Dezhou Univ, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biophys, Inst Biophys, Dezhou 253023, Peoples R China; [Bian, Yunqiang; Zhang, Jian; Wang, Wei] Nanjing Univ, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Dept Phys, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China; [Bian, Yunqiang; Zhang, Jian; Wang, Wei] Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China","Bian, YQ; Wang, JH (corresponding author), Dezhou Univ, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biophys, Inst Biophys, Dezhou 253023, Peoples R China.; Bian, YQ; Wang, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Dept Phys, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.; Bian, YQ; Wang, W (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Adv Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China.",bianyunqiang@gmail.com; jhw25336@126.com; wangwei@nju.edu.cn,"Zhang, Jian/A-5886-2017","Zhang, Jian/0000-0003-2338-0395; S, Feng/0000-0001-5211-2803","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11504043, 11934008, 61671107, 11774158, 61771093]; Taishan Young Scholars Program of Shandong Province of China [tsqn20161049]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant nos. 11504043, 11934008, 61671107, 11774158, and 61771093] and the Taishan Young Scholars Program of Shandong Province of China [grant no. tsqn20161049].",,97,0,0,9,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Data collated from protein dynamics can be translated into useful statistics that can be exploited to sieve thermodynamics and kinetics crucial for the elucidation of mechanisms responsible for the modulation of biological processes such as protein-ligand binding and protein-protein association. Continuous modernization of simulation tools enables accurate prediction and characterization of the aforementioned mechanisms and these qualities are highly beneficial for the expedition of drug development when effectively applied to structure-based drug design (SBDD). In this review, current all-atom MD simulation methods, with focus on enhanced sampling techniques, utilized to examine protein structure, dynamics, and functions are discussed. This review will pivot around computer calculations of protein-ligand and protein-protein systems with applications to SBDD.

However, increasing evidence clearly indicates that enzymes do not remain fixed or operate exclusively in or close to their native structure. Different parts of the enzyme (from individual residues to full domains) undergo concerted motions on a wide range of time-scales, including that of the catalyzed reaction. Information obtained on these internal motions and conformational fluctuations has so far uncovered and explained many aspects of enzyme mechanisms, which could not have been understood from a single structure alone. Although there is wide interest in understanding enzyme dynamics and its role in catalysis, several challenges remain. In addition to technical difficulties, the vast majority of investigations are performed in dilute aqueous solutions, where conditions are significantly different than the cellular milieu where a large number of enzymes operate. In this review, we discuss recent developments, several challenges as well as opportunities related to this topic. The benefits of considering dynamics as an integral part of the enzyme function can also enable new means of biocatalysis, engineering enzymes for industrial and medicinal applications.","[Agarwal, Pratul K.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Physiol Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Agarwal, Pratul K.] Oklahoma State Univ, High Performance Comp Ctr, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Agarwal, Pratul K.] Arium BioLabs, 2519 Caspian Dr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA; [Bernard, David N.; Doucet, Nicolas] Univ Quebec, Ctr Armand Frappier Sante Biotechnol, Inst Natl Rech Sci INRS, 531 Blvd Prairies, Laval, PQ H7V 1B7, Canada; [Bafna, Khushboo] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Bafna, Khushboo] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Doucet, Nicolas] Univ Laval, Quebec Network Res Prot Funct Struct & Engn, PROTEO, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada","Agarwal, PK (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Physiol Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.; Agarwal, PK (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, High Performance Comp Ctr, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.; Agarwal, PK (corresponding author), Arium BioLabs, 2519 Caspian Dr, Knoxville, TN 37932 USA.; Doucet, N (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Ctr Armand Frappier Sante Biotechnol, Inst Natl Rech Sci INRS, 531 Blvd Prairies, Laval, PQ H7V 1B7, Canada.; Doucet, N (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Quebec Network Res Prot Funct Struct & Engn, PROTEO, 1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",pratul.agarwal@okstate.edu; nicolas.doucet@inrs.ca,,"Bafna, Khushboo/0000-0002-1893-1175",National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health USA [GM105978]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2016-05557]; Fonds de Recherche Quebec - Sante (FRQS) Research Scholar Senior Career Award [281993],"This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health USA under award number GM105978, and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2016-05557 to N.D.).

We present a molecular dynamics simulation study on the binding mechanism of the membrane targeting domain of HIV-1 Gag protein. The matrix (MA) domain drives Gag onto the plasma membrane through electrostatic interactions at its highly-basic-region (HBR), located near the myristoylated (Myr) N-terminus of the protein. Our study suggests Myr insertion is involved in the sorting of membrane lipids around the protein-binding site to prepare it for viral assembly. Our realistic membrane models confirm interactions with PIP2 and PS lipids are highly favored around the HBR and are strong enough to keep the protein bound even without Myr insertion. We characterized Myr insertion events from microsecond trajectories and examined the membrane response upon initial membrane targeting by MA. Insertion events only occur with one of the membrane models, showing a combination of surface charge and internal membrane structure modulate this process.","[Voth, Gregory A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago Ctr Theoret Chem, Inst Biophys Dynam, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Voth, GA (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago Ctr Theoret Chem, Inst Biophys Dynam, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",gavoth@uchicago.edu,,"Monje-Galvan, Viviana/0000-0002-9202-782X",National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM063796]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM116961]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1548562],"National Institute of General Medical Sciences R01GM063796 Viviana Monje-Galvan Gregory A Voth; National Institutes of Health R01GM116961 Gregory A Voth; National Science Foundation ACI-1548562 Gregory A Voth; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,68,0,0,1,1,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,AUG 18,2020,9,,,,,,,,e58621,10.7554/eLife.58621,,,23,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,NO3JQ,WOS:000569382000001,32808928,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

Elucidating the affinity maturation process is fundamental in understanding immunity and in the development of biotherapeutics. Therefore, we analyzed 10 pairs of antibody fragments differing in their specificity and in distinct stages of affinity maturation using metadynamics in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We investigated differences in flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop and global changes in plasticity upon affinity maturation. Among all antibody pairs we observed a substantial rigidification in flexibility and plasticity reflected in a substantial decrease of conformational diversity. To visualize and characterize these findings we used Markov-states models to reconstruct the kinetics of CDR-H3 loop dynamics and for the first time provide a method to define and localize surface plasticity upon affinity maturation.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Loeffler, Johannes R.; Bacher, Lisa M.; Waibl, Franz; Seidler, Clarissa A.; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]",This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grants P30565 and P30737.,,92,0,0,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-889X,,FRONT MOL BIOSCI,Front.

Here, we track each step of the binding process in atomistic detail with molecular dynamics simulations using trypsin and its inhibitor bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) as a model system. We use umbrella sampling to cover a range of unbinding pathways. Starting from these simulations, we subsequently seed classical simulations at different stages of the process and combine them to a Markov state model. We clearly identify three kinetically separated states (an unbound state, an encounter state, and the final complex) and describe the mechanisms that dominate the binding process. From our model, we propose the following sequence of events. The initial formation of the encounter complex is driven by long-range interactions because opposite charges in trypsin and BPTI draw them together. The encounter complex features the prealigned binding partners with binding sites still partially surrounded by solvation shells. Further approaching leads to desolvation and increases the importance of van der Waals interactions. The native binding pose is adopted by maximizing shortrange interactions. Thereby side-chain rearrangements ensure optimal shape complementarity. In particular, BPTI's P1 residue adapts to the 51 pocket and prime site residues reorient to optimize interactions. After the paradigm of conformation selection, binding-competent conformations of BPTI and trypsin are already present in the apo ensembles and their probabilities increase during this proposed two-step association process. This detailed characterization of the molecular forces driving the binding process includes numerous aspects that have been discussed as central to the binding of trypsin and BPTI and protein complex formation in general. In this study, we combine all these aspects into one comprehensive model of protein recognition. We thereby contribute to enhance our general understanding of this fundamental mechanism, which is particularly critical as the development of biopharmaceuticals continuously gains significance.","[Kahler, Ursula; Kamenik, Anna S.; Waibl, Franz; Kraml, Johannes; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innsbruck, Austria.",klaus.liedl@uibk.ac.at,,"Kamenik, Anna Sophia/0000-0001-8657-0036","Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]; University of Innsbruck","The authors thank Florian Hofer, Patrick Quoika, and Alexander Spinn for their input in fruitful discussions.

While osmolytes are prevalently hypothesized to stabilize proteins by preferentially excluding themselves from the protein surface, emerging experimental and theoretical lines of evidence of preferential binding of the popular osmolyte trimethyl amine N-oxide (TMAO) to some protein surfaces are contradicting this view. Here, we address these contrasting perspectives by investigating the folding mechanism of a set of mini proteins in aqueous solutions of two different osmolytes glycine and TMAO via free energy simulations. Our results demonstrate that, while both osmolytes are found to stabilize the folded conformation of the mini proteins, their mechanisms of action can be mutually opposite: Specifically, glycine always depletes from the surface of all mini proteins, thereby conforming to the osmophobic model, but TMAO is found to display ambivalent signatures of protein-specific preferential binding to and exclusion from the protein surface. At the molecular level, the presence of an extended hydrophobic patch in protein topology is found to be a recurrent motif in proteins leading to favorable binding with TMAO. Finally, an analysis combining the preferential interaction theory and folding free energetics reveals that irrespective of preferential binding vs exclusion of osmolytes, it is the relative preferential depletion of osmolytes on transition from folded to unfolded conformations of proteins, which drives the overall conformational equilibrium toward the folded state in the presence of osmolytes. Taken together, moving beyond the model system and hypothesis, this work brings out contrasting mechanisms of stabilizing osmolytes on proteins and provides a unifying justification.","[Mukherjee, Mrinmoy; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500046, India","Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500046, India.",jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,"Mukherjee, Mrinmoy/0000-0003-4927-2464","TIFR, DAE, India; Department of Science and Technology (DST) of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [CRG/2019/001219]","This work was supported by computing resources obtained from shared facility of the TIFR Center for Interdisciplinary Sciences, India.

On the molecular level, however, the interaction dynamics of this covalently bound drug-protein complex has been undetermined. Here, we disclose the interaction dynamics of the KRAS(G12C)-AMG 510 complex by long timescale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (total of 75 mu s). Moreover, we investigated the influence of the recently reported post-translational modification (PTM) of KRAS' N-terminus, removal of initiator methionine (iMet1) with acetylation of Thr2, to this complex. Our results demonstrate that AMG 510 does not entrap KRAS into a single conformation, as one would expect based on the crystal structure, but rather into an ensemble of conformations. AMG 510 binding is extremely stable regardless of highly dynamic interface of KRAS' switches. Overall, KRAS(G12C)-AMG 510 complex partially mimic the native dynamics of GDP bound KRAS; however, AMG 510 stabilizes the alpha 3-helix region. N-terminally modified KRAS displays similar interaction dynamics with AMG 510 as when Met1 is present, but this PTM appears to stabilize beta 2-beta 3-loop. These results provide novel conformational insights on the molecular level to KRAS(G12C)-AMG 510 interactions and dynamics, providing new perspectives to RAS related drug discovery.","[Pantsar, Tatu] Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmaceut & Med Chem, Tubingen, Germany; [Pantsar, Tatu] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, Kuopio, Finland","Pantsar, T (corresponding author), Eberhard Karls Univ Tubingen, Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharmaceut & Med Chem, Tubingen, Germany.; Pantsar, T (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, Kuopio, Finland.",tatu.pantsar@uef.fi,,,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie GrantEuropean Union (EU) [839230]; Orion Research Foundation; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publishing Fund of University of Tubingen,"CSC-IT Center for Science Ltd.

The main protease, responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein is considered as one of the hot targets for treating COVID-19. Earlier reports suggest the use of HIV anti-viral drugs for targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the year 2002-2003. Hence, drug repurposing approach may prove to be useful in targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The high-resolution crystal structure of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LU7) was used as the target. The Food and Drug Administration approved and SWEETLEAD database of drug molecules were screened. The apo form of the main protease was simulated for a cumulative of 150 ns and 10 mu s open-source simulation data was used, to obtain conformations for ensemble docking. The representative structures for docking were selected using RMSD-based clustering and Markov State Modeling analysis. This ensemble docking approach for the main protease helped in exploring the conformational variation in the drug-binding site of the main protease leading to the efficient binding of more relevant drug molecules. The drugs obtained as top hits from the ensemble docking possessed anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.

The affinity is predominantly determined by structure and sequence of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of which the CDR3 loops are responsible for peptide recognition. We present a kinetic classification of T-cell receptor CDR3 loops with different loop lengths into canonical and non-canonical solution structures. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we do not only sample available X-ray structures, but we also observe a substantially broader CDR3 loop ensemble with various distinct kinetic minima in solution. Our results strongly imply, that for given CDR3 loop sequences several canonical structures have to be considered to characterize the conformational diversity of these loops. Our suggested dominant solution structures could extend the repertoire of available canonical clusters by including kinetic minimum structures present in solution. Thus, the CDR3 loops need to be characterized as conformational ensembles in solution. Furthermore, the conformational changes of the CDR3 loops follow the paradigm of conformational selection, because the experimentally determined binding competent state is present within this ensemble of pre-existing conformations without the presence of the antigen. We also identify strong correlations between the CDR3 loops and include combined state descriptions. Additionally, we observe a strong dependency of the CDR3 loop conformations on the relative V alpha-V beta interdomain orientations, revealing that certain CDR3 loop states favor specific interface orientations.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Pomarici, Nancy D.; Loeffler, Johannes R.; Seidler, Clarissa A.; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck CMBI, Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Dept Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck CMBI, Innsbruck, Austria.",klaus.liedl@uibk.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]",This work was supported by Austrian Science Fund (P30565 and P30737).,,72,1,1,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

Markov State Models (MSMs) provide a powerful approach to study these dynamic processes by predicting long time scale dynamics based on many short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In an MSM, protein dynamics are modeled as a kinetic process consisting of a series of Markovian transitions between different conformational states at discrete time intervals (called lag time). To achieve this, a master equation must be constructed with a sufficiently long lag time to allow interstate transitions to become truly Markovian. This imposes a major challenge for MSM studies of proteins since the lag time is bound by the length of relatively short MD simulations available to estimate the frequency of transitions. Here, we show how one can employ the generalized master equation formalism to obtain an exact description of protein conformational dynamics both at short and long time scales without the time resolution restrictions imposed by the MSM lag time. Using a simple kinetic model, alanine dipeptide, and WW domain, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct these quasi-Markov State Models (qMSMs) using MD simulations that are 5-10 times shorter than those required by MSMs. These qMSMs only contain a handful of metastable states and, thus, can greatly facilitate the interpretation of mechanisms associated with protein dynamics. A qMSM opens the door to the study of conformational changes of complex biomolecules where a Markovian model with a few states is often difficult to construct due to the limited length of available MD simulations.","[Cao, Siqin; Wang, Wei; Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Montoya-Castillo, Andres; Markland, Thomas E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xuhui] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hitech Pk, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Markland, TE (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Syst Biol & Human Hlth, State Key Lab Mol Neurosci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Huang, XH (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Res Inst, Hitech Pk, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",tmarkland@stanford.edu; xuhuihuang@ust.hk,,"Huang, Xuhui/0000-0002-7119-9358; Markland, Thomas/0000-0002-2747-0518","Hong Kong Research Grant CouncilHong Kong Research Grants Council [16303919, AoE/P-705/16]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [JCYJ20170413173837121]; Innovation and Technology Commission [ITCPD/17-9]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0020203]; Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Awards Program","X.H. and S.C. were supported by the Hong Kong Research Grant Council (Grant Nos. 16303919 and AoE/P-705/16), the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (Grant No. JCYJ20170413173837121), and the Innovation and Technology Commission (Grant No. ITCPD/17-9).

A key approach in deciphering the mechanism underlying the recognition process is to capture the kinetic process of the ligand in its act of binding to its designated protein cavity. Toward this end, ultralong all-atom molecular dynamics simulation has recently emerged as a popular method of choice because of its ability to record these events at high spatial and temporal resolution. However, success via this route comes at an exorbitant computational cost. Herein, we demonstrate that coarse-grained models of the protein, when systematically optimized to maintain its tertiary fold, can capture the complete process of spontaneous protein-ligand binding from bulk media to the cavity at crystallographic precision and within wall clock time that is orders of magnitude shorter than that of all-atom simulations. The exhaustive sampling of ligand exploration in protein and solvent, harnessed by coarse-grained simulation, leads to elucidation of new ligand recognition pathways and discovery of non-native binding poses.","[Dandekar, Bhupendra R.; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500046, India","Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500046, India.",jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,"DANDEKAR, BHUPENDRA/0000-0002-2734-6090","TIFR, DAE, India; Ramanujan FellowshipDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Department of Science and Technology (DST) of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [CRG/2019/001219]","This work was supported by computing resources obtained from shared facility of TIFR Center for Interdisciplinary Sciences, India.

It has been recently shown that different anionic lipid types can affect the spatiotemporal properties of RAS through dimerization/clustering and signaling fidelity. To understand the effects of anionic lipids on key spatiotemporal properties of RAS, we dissected 1 ms of data from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for KRAS4B on two model anionic lipid membranes that have 30% of POPS mixed with neutral POPC and 8% of PIP2 mixed with POPC. We unveiled the orientation space of KRAS4B, whose kinetics were slower and more distinguishable on the membrane containing PIP2 than the membrane containing POPS. Particularly, the PIP2-mixed membrane can differentiate a third kinetic orientation state from the other two known orientation states. We observed that each orientation state may yield different binding modes with an RAF kinase, which is required for activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. However, an overall occluded probability, for which RAF kinases cannot bind KRAS4B, remains unchanged on the two different membranes. We identified rare fast diffusion modes of KRAS4B that appear coupled with orientations exposed to cytosolic RAF. Particularly, on the membrane having PIP2, we found nonlinear correlations between the orientation states and the conformations of the cationic farnesylated hypervariable region, which acts as an anchor in the membrane. Using diffusion coefficients estimated from the all-atom simulations, we quantified the effect of PIP2 and POPS on the KRAS4B dimerization via Green's function reaction dynamics simulations, in which the averaged dimerization rate is 12.5% slower on PIP2-mixed membranes.","[Ngo, Van A.; Sarkar, Sumantra; Garcia, Angel E.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Nonlinear Studies CNLS, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Neale, Chris] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, T-6, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr Nonlinear Studies CNLS, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",agarcia@lanl.gov,,"Ngo, Van/0000-0001-8350-1203","LANLUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory [20170692PRD4]; Director's postdoctoral fellowship [20160676PRD4]; JDACS4C program by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); U.S. DOE by Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; U.S. DOE by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) [DE-AC5206NA25396]; U.S. DOE by Oak Ridge National Laboratory [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; U.S. DOE by Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research [HHSN261200800001E]; LDRD funds [XWJX, XX01]; U.S. DOE National Nuclear Security AdministrationNational Nuclear Security AdministrationUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-06NA25396]","V.A.N. is a Director's postdoctoral fellow at LANL and is fully supported by this fellowship (20170692PRD4).

In this study we aim to understand the structural causes of the low sensitivity of a [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase, when compared with a [NiFe] class enzyme, by studying the diffusion of O-2. To unravel the differences between the two enzymes, we used computational methods comprising Molecular Dynamics simulations with explicit O-2 and Implicit Ligand Sampling methodologies. With the latter, we were able to map the free energy landscapes for O-2 permeation in both enzymes. We derived pathways from these energy landscapes and selected the kinetically more relevant ones with reactive flux analysis using transition path theory. These studies evidence the existence of quite different pathways in both enzymes and predict a lower permeation efficiency for O-2 in the case of the [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase when compared with the [NiFe] enzyme. These differences can explain the experimentally observed lower inhibition by O-2 on [NiFeSe]-hydrogenases, when compared with [NiFe]-hydrogenases.

In this method, multiple independent MD simulations are iteratively conducted from initial structures randomly selected from the vertices of a multi-dimensional principal component subspace. This subspace is defined by an ensemble of protein conformations sampled during previous cycles of eePaCS-MD. The edges and vertices of the conformational subspace are determined by solving the convex hull problem. The sampling efficiency of eePaCS-MD is achieved by intensively repeating MD simulations from the vertex structures, which increases the probability of rare event occurrence to explore new large-amplitude collective motions. The conformational sampling efficiency of eePaCS-MD was assessed by investigating the open-close transitions of glutamine binding protein, maltose/maltodextrin binding protein, and adenylate kinase and comparing the results to those obtained using related methods. In all cases, the open-close transitions were simulated in similar to 10 ns of simulation time or less, offering 1-3 orders of magnitude shorter simulation time compared to conventional MD. Furthermore, we show that the combination of eePaCS-MD and accelerated MD can further enhance conformational sampling efficiency, which reduced the total computational cost of observing the open-close transitions by at most 36%.","[Takaba, Kenichiro] Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp, Med Chem Lab, Pharmaceut Res Ctr, 632-1 Mifuku, Izunokuni, Shizuoka 4102321, Japan; [Takaba, Kenichiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Phys, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Tran, Duy Phuoc; Kitao, Akio] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan","Kitao, A (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan.",akitao@bio.titech.ac.jp,"Kitao, Akio/B-8371-2008; Tran, Duy/A-9866-2014","Kitao, Akio/0000-0002-5221-0806; Tran, Duy/0000-0001-8212-3706","MEXT/JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP15H04357, JP17KT0026, JP19H03191, JP20H05439, JP19K23721]; MEXT Priority Issues on Post-K Computer Projects Building Innovative Drug Discovery Infrastructure through Functional Control of Biomolecular SystemMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science through the HPCI System Research project [hp170254, hp180201, hp190181]","This research was supported by the MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Nos.

The latter involves an intramolecular proton transfer between a zinc-bound water and a distant histidine residue (His-64). In the absence of time-resolved experiments, results from classical and QM-MM molecular dynamics and transition path sampling simulations are presented. The catalytic zinc ion is found to be present in two possible coordination states; viz. a stable tetra-coordinated state, T and a less stable penta-coordinated state, P with tetrahedral and trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometries, respectively. A fast dynamical inter-conversion occurs between T and P due to reorganization of active site water molecules making the zinc ion more positively charged in state P. When initiated from different coordination environments, the most probable mechanism of proton transfer is found to be deprotonation of the equatorial water molecule from state P and transfer of the excess proton via a short path formed by hydrogen bonded network of active site water molecules. We estimate the rate constant of proton transfer as kP=1.29x106s-1 from P and kT=4.37x104s-1 from T.

Available structures of gp120 indicate that it exhibits two distinct conformational states, called closed and open states. Although experimental data demonstrates that CD4 binding stabilizes open state of gp120, detailed structural dynamics and kinetics of gp120 during this process remain elusive. Here, two open-state gp120 simulation systems, one without any ligands (ligand-free) and the other complexed with CD4 (CD4-bound), were subjected to microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations following the conformational transitions and allosteric pathways of gp120 evaluated by using the Markov state model and a network-based method, respectively. Our results provide an atomic-resolution description of gp120 conformational transitions, suggesting that gp120 is intrinsically dynamic from the open state to closed state, whereas CD4 binding blocks these transitions. Consistent with experimental structures, five metastable conformations with different orientations of the V1/V2 region and V3 loop have been extracted. The binding of CD4 significantly enhances allosteric communications from the CD4-binding site to V3 loop and beta 20-21 hairpin, resulting in high-affinity interactions with coreceptors and activation of the conformational transitions switcher, respectively. This study will facilitate the structural understanding of the CD4-binding effects on conformational transitions and allosteric pathways of gp120.","[Li, Yi; Guo, Yu-Chen; Zhang, Xiao-Ling] Dali Univ, Coll Math & Comp Sci, Dali, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lei; Liu, Shu-Qun] Yunnan Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sang, Peng; Yang, Li-Quan] Dali Univ, Coll Agr & Biol Sci, Dali, Peoples R China","Liu, SQ (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Bioresources Y, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Yang, LQ (corresponding author), Dali Univ, Coll Agr & Biol Sci, Dali, Peoples R China.",ylqbioinfo@gmail.com; shuqunliu@ynu.edu.cn,,,"Startup Foundation for Advanced Talents of Dali University [KYBS2018031]; Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects [2019FD014, 2019FB021]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31960198]","This study was funded by the Startup Foundation for Advanced Talents of Dali University (No. KYBS2018031), the Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects (No. 2019FD014 and 2019FB021), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31960198).",,33,1,1,2,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0005-2736,1879-2642,,BBA-BIOMEMBRANES,Biochim.

However, it remains unclear how tau monomers undergo conformational changes and further lead to the abnormal aggregation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulation combined with the Markov state model (MSM) analysis was used to uncover the misfolding progress and structural characteristics of the key R3 fragment of tau protein at the atomic level. The simulation results show that R3 exists in disordered structures mainly, which is consistent with the experimental results. The MSM analysis identified multiple beta-sheet conformations of R3. The residues involved in the beta-sheet structure formation are mainly located in three regions: PHF6 at the N-terminal, S324 to N327 at the middle of R3, and K331 to G334 at the C-terminal. In addition, the path analysis of the formation of the beta-sheet structure by transition path theory (TPT) revealed that there are multiple paths to form beta-sheet structures from the disordered state, and the timescales are at the millisecond level, indicating that a large number of structural rearrangements occur during the formation of beta-sheet structures. It is interesting to note that S19 is a critical intermediate state for the formation of two target beta-sheet structures, S23 and S4. In S19, three regions of V306 to K311, C322 to G326, and K331 to G334 form a turn structure, the regions that form the beta-sheet structure in target states S23 and S4, indicating that the formation of a turn structure is necessary to form a beta-sheet structure and then the turn structure will eventually transform into the beta-sheet structure through key hydrogen bonding interactions. These findings can provide insights into the kinetics of tau protein misfolding.","[Liu, Hongli; Xu, Zerong; Zhang, Qianqian; Shah, Syed Jawad Ali; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongli] Xuzhou Med Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab New Drug Res & Clin Pharm, Xuzhou 221004, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Haiyang; Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Haiyang; Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, Dept Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macau Inst Appl Res Med & Hlth, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Taipa 999078, Macao, Peoples R China","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",hxliu@lzu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Huanxiang/0000-0002-9284-3667","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21973035, 21675070]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21973035 and 21675070).,,70,0,0,12,12,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

Here, we investigate the scenario in which the trimer is disrupted to observe whether monomeric NP undergoes significant conformational changes. From multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and an adaptive sampling scheme to sample the conformational space, a Markov state model (MSM) is constructed. The MSM reveals an energetically favorable conformational change, with the most significant changes occurring at the domain interface.

Their soluble isoforms, functioning as decoy receptors, contain only the ectodomain. Whether the ectodomains of cytokine receptors at the membrane exhibit different conformational dynamics from their soluble forms is unknown. Using Stimulation-2 (ST2) as an example, we performed microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the conformational dynamics of the soluble and the membrane-bound ST2 (sST2 and ST2). Combined use of accelerated and conventional MD simulations enabled extensive sampling of the conformational space of sST2 for comparison with ST2. Using the interdomain loop conformation as the reaction coordinate, we built a Markov State Model to determine the slowest implied timescale of the conformational transition in sST2 and ST2. We found that the ectodomain of ST2 undergoes slower conformational relaxation but exhibits a faster rate of conformational transition in a more restricted conformational space than sST2. Analyses of the relaxed conformations of ST2 further suggest important contributions of interdomain salt-bridge interactions to the stabilization of different ST2 conformations. Our study elucidates differential conformational properties between sST2 and ST2 that may be exploited for devising strategies to selectively target each isoform.","[Yang, Chao-Yie] Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Yang, CY (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cyang26@uthsc.edu,"Yang, Chao-Yie/A-3930-2015","Yang, Chao-Yie/0000-0002-5445-0109",National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01HL141432]; University of Tennessee Health Science Center,This work was supported in part from the National Institute of Health (R01HL141432) and the startup fund from University of Tennessee Health Science Center.

We show that a collective variable, originally proposed for crystalline solids, is able to filter out essential macromolecular motions more efficiently than other approaches. While homogeneous or affine deformations of the biopolymer are trivial, biopolymer conformations are complicated by the occurrence of inhomogeneous or nonaffine displacements of atoms relative to their positions in the native structure. We show that these displacements encode functionally relevant conformations of macromolecules, and in combination with a formalism based upon time-structured independent component analysis, they quantitatively resolve the free energy landscape of a number of macromolecules of hierarchical complexity. The kinetics of conformational transitions among the basins can now be mapped within the framework of a Markov state model. The nonaffine modes, obtained by projecting out homogeneous fluctuations from the local displacements, are found to be responsible for local structural changes required for transitioning between pairs of macrostates.","[Prakashchand, Dube Dheeraj; Ahalawat, Navjeet; Bandyopadhyay, Satyabrata; Sengupta, Surajit; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, India; [Ahalawat, Navjeet] Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agr Univ, Dept Mol Biol Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India","Sengupta, S; Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, India.",surajit@tifrh.res.in; jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,"Ahalawat, Navjeet/0000-0002-9665-8709","TIFR, IndiaTata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Department of Science and Technology (DST) of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [CRG/2019/001219]","This work was supported by the computing resources obtained from the shared facility of the TIFR Center for Interdisciplinary Sciences, India.

Using a combination of cycles of association and dissociation parallel cascade molecular dynamics, multiple standard molecular dynamics (MD), and the Markov state model, we were successful in obtaining the lowest free energy structure of the MDM2/TAD-p53 complex as the structure closest to the crystal structure without prior knowledge of the crystal structure. This method also reproduced the experimentally measured standard binding free energy, and the association and dissociation rate constants, requiring only an accumulated MD simulation cost of 11.675 mu s even though that actual dissociation occurs on the order of seconds. We identified few complex intermediates with similar free energies; yet TAD-p53 first binds MDM2 as the second lowest free energy intermediate kinetically with >90% of the flux, adopting a conformation similar to that of one of these few intermediates in its monomeric state. Even though the mechanism of the first step has a conformational-selection-type aspect, the second step shows induced-fit-like features and occurs as concomitant dehydration of the interface, side-chain pi-pi stacking, and main-chain hydrogen-bond formation to complete binding as an alpha-helix. In addition, dehydration is a key process for the final relaxation process around the complex interface. These results demonstrate that TAD-p53 kinetically selects its initial binding form and then relaxes to complete the binding.","[Duy Phuoc Tran; Kitao, Akio] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528550, Japan","Kitao, A (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528550, Japan.",akitao@bio.titech.ac.jp,"Duy, TRAN Phuoc/N-9948-2019; Kitao, Akio/B-8371-2008","Duy, TRAN Phuoc/0000-0001-8212-3706; Kitao, Akio/0000-0002-5221-0806","MEXT/JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP19K23721, JP25104002, JP15H04357, JP17KT0026, JP19H03191]; MEXT as Priority Issue on Post-K Computer (Building Innovative Drug Discovery Infrastructure through Functional Control of Biomolecular Systems)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science through the HPCI System Research Project [hp150270, hp160207, hp170254, hp180201, hp190181]; Hitachi Scholarship program from the Hitachi Global Foundation [S175]","We thank Drs.

As the starting hypothesis leading to the discovery, we postulated a stabilizing effect achieved by binding of the dipeptide to an aggregation prone region on the protein's surface. Here we present a detailed study of the interaction mechanism between the dipeptide and Interferon-alpha-2A (IFN) through the construction of a Markov state model from molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify multiple binding sites and compare these to aggregation prone regions. Additionally, we calculate the lifetime of the protein-excipient complex. If the excipient remained bound to IFN after administration, it could alter the protein's therapeutic efficacy. We establish that the lifetime of the complex between IFN and glycyl-D-asparagine is extremely short. Under these circumstances, stabilization by stoichiometric binding is consequently no impediment for a safe use of an excipient.","[Tosstorff, Andreas; Winter, Gerhard] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Pharm Pharmaceut Technol & Biopharmaceut, Munich, Germany; [Peters, Guenther H.

In response to injury, inflammation or infection its production increases highly, which may lead to aggregation of the protein and accumulation of its deposits in various organs. Due to the cellular toxicity of the aggregates, as well as the fact that accumulated deposits are a burden that obstructs proper functioning of the affected tissues, it is vital to find a way to suppress the process of pathological aggregates formation. To make this possible, it is necessary to investigate thoroughly the oligomerization process and recognize factors that may influence its course. Some previous studies showed that aromatic interactions are important to the potential of an inhibitor to suppress the aggregation process. In our research we had proved that a five-residue peptide RSFFS (saa1-5) is an efficient inhibitor of aggregation of the most amyloidogenic fragment of SAA1.1, SAA1-12. In the present work the oligomerization and aggregation propensity of SAA1-12 was compared to that of SAA1-27, in order to determine the contribution of the sequence which extends beyond the most amyloidogenic region but encompasses residues reportedly involved in the stabilization of the SAA native conformation. Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, quantitative chromatographic analysis of the insoluble fraction and transmission electron microscopy allowed for a deeper insight into the SAA aggregation process and the morphology of aggregates. Substitutions of Phe3 and/or Phe4 residues in saa1-5 sequence with tryptophan, tyrosine, homophenylalanine, naphthylalanine and beta,beta-diphenylalanine allowed to study the influence of different aromatic systems on the aggregation of SAA1-12 and SAA1-27, and evaluate these results in relation to hSAA1.1 protein. Our results indicate that compounds with aromatic moieties can affect the course of the aggregation process and change the ratio between the soluble and insoluble aggregates.","[Skibiszewska, Sandra; Jedrzejewska, Katarzyna; Jankowska, Elzbieta] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Dept Biomed Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Zaczek, Szymon; Dybala-Defratyka, Agnieszka] Lodz Univ Technol, Fac Chem, Inst Appl Radiat Chem, Zeromskiego 116, PL-90924 Lodz, Poland","Jankowska, E (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Dept Biomed Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",elzbieta.jankowska@ug.edu.pl,"Dybala-Defratyka, Agnieszka/O-9802-2019","Dybala-Defratyka, Agnieszka/0000-0002-8939-2279; Jedrzejewska, Katarzyna/0000-0001-7831-7938","Ministry of Science and Higher EducationMinistry of Science and Higher Education, Poland [DI2015 022445]; PLGrid Infrastructure",This scientific work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education [Diamond grant DI2015 022445]; and in part by PLGrid Infrastructure.,,34,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0003-9861,1096-0384,,ARCH BIOCHEM BIOPHYS,Arch.

Here, we reported the discovery of novel inhibitors for striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP), a potential drug target for multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, based on cryptic pocket detection. By combining the use of molecular dynamics simulations and fragment-centric topographical mapping, we identified transiently open cryptic pockets and identified 12 new STEP inhibition scaffolds through structure-based virtual screening. Site-directed mutagenesis verified the binding of ST3 with the predicted cryptic pockets.

Particularly when the lifetimes of these states approach the millisecond timescale, identifying the relevant structures and the mechanism by which they interconvert remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce a novel combination of accelerated MD (aMD) simulations and Markov state modelling (MSM) to explore these 'excited' conformational states. Applying this to the highly dynamic protein CypA, a protein involved in immune response and associated with HIV infection, we identify five principally populated conformational states and the atomistic mechanism by which they interconvert. A rational design strategy predicted that the mutant D66A should stabilise the minor conformations and substantially alter the dynamics, whereas the similar mutant H70A should leave the landscape broadly unchanged. These predictions are confirmed using CPMG and R-1 rho solution state NMR measurements. By efficiently exploring functionally relevant, but sparsely populated conformations with millisecond lifetimes in silico, our aMD/MSM method has tremendous promise for the design of dynamic protein free energy landscapes for both protein engineering and drug discovery.","[Juarez-Jimenez, Jordi; Gupta, Arun A.; Mey, Antonia S.

Tyro3, Axl and Mer are members of TAM RTKs and are overexpressed in several cancer forms. Kinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib, foretinib are reported to inhibit TAM kinases at nanomolar concentrations. The atomistic details of structure and mechanism of functional regulation is required to understand their normal physiological process and when bound to an inhibitor. The docking of cabozantinib into the active state conformations of TAM kinases (crystal structure and computational models) revealed the best binding pose and the complex formation that is mediated through non-bonding interactions involving the hinge region residues. The alterations in the conformations and the regions of flexibility in apo and complexed TAM kinases as a course of time are studied using 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The post-MD trajectory analysis using Python libraries like ProDy, MDTraj and PyEMMA revealed encrypted protein dynamic motions in active kinetic metastable states. Comparison between Principal component analysis and Anisotropic mode analysis deciphered structural residue interactions and salt bridge contacts between apo and inhibitor bound TAM kinases. Various structural changes occurred in alpha C-helix and activation loop involving hydrogen bonding between residues from Lys-(beta 3 sheet), Glu-(alpha C-helix) and Asp-(DFG-motif) resulting in higher RMSD. Mechanical stiffness plots revealed that similar regions in apo and cabozantinib bound Axl fluctuated during MD simulations whereas different regions in Tyro3 and Mer kinases.

Here we examine the resulting Markov model in greater detail by analyzing its metastable states. A characterization of the states in terms of their DFG state, P-loop, and alpha C conformations is presented and compared to existing classification schemes. Several metastable states are found to be structurally close to known crystal structures of different kinases in complex with a variety of inhibitors. These results suggest that the set of conformations accessible to tyrosine kinases may be shared within the entire family and that the conformational dynamics of one kinase in the absence of any ligand can provide meaningful information about possible target conformations for inhibitors of any member of the kinase family.","[Paul, Fabian; Meng, Yilin; Roux, Benoit] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Roux, B (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",roux@uchicago.edu,,"Roux, Benoit/0000-0002-5254-2712",Yen Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research; National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [CA093577]; Lilly Research Award Program (LRAP),"F.P. acknowledges funding from the Yen Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Research.

However, the computational cost and/or the accuracy of these models remains a bottleneck in carrying out these simulations for complex or large scale systems, as in the case of catalysis. Over the past two decades, machine learning (ML) has made an impact in the field of computational catalysis. Modern-day researchers have started using machine learning-based data-driven techniques to overcome the limitations of these molecular simulations. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the utilization of ML algorithms to assist molecular simulations, followed by its applications in the field of catalysis. Furthermore, we provide our perspective on promising avenues for research in the future regarding the incorporation of ML in molecular simulations in catalysis.","[Orupattur, Nilesh Varadan; Mushrif, Samir H.; Prasad, Vinay] Univ Alberta, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, 9211-116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada","Prasad, V (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, 9211-116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",vprasad@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR,The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada in the form of Discovery grants.,,170,0,0,14,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-0256,1879-0801,,COMP MATER SCI,Comput.

While the solvent is often depicted as a source of barrier in the ligand recognition process by the polar cavity, the nature of solvent's role in the recognition process involving hydrophobic cavity and hydrophobic ligand remains to be addressed. In this work, we quantitatively assess the role of solvent in dictating the kinetic process of recognition in a popular system involving the hydrophobic cavity and ligand. In this prototypical system, the hydrophobic cavity undergoes dewetting transition as the ligand approaches the cavity, which influences the cavity-ligand recognition kinetics. Here, we build a Markov state model (MSM) using adaptively sampled unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to map the kinetic recognition process. The MSM-reconstructed free energy surface recovers a broad water distribution at an intermediate cavity-ligand separation, consistent with a previous report of dewetting transition in this system. Time-structured independent component analysis of the simulated trajectories quantitatively shows that cavity-solvent density contributes considerably in an optimized reaction coordinate involving cavity-ligand separation and water occupancy. Our approach quantifies two solvent-mediated macrostates at an intermediate separation of the cavity-ligand recognition pathways, apart from the fully ligand-bound and fully ligand-unbound macrostates. Interestingly, we find that these water-mediated intermediates, while transient in populations, can undergo slow mutual interconversion and create possibilities of multiple pathways of cavity recognition by the ligand. Overall, the work provides a quantitative assessment of the role that the solvent plays in facilitating the recognition process involving the hydrophobic cavity.

In the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 most protease cleavage sites are located within its secondary structure elements, which are inherently inaccessible to proteases. The allergen thus must unfold locally, exposing the cleavage sites to become susceptible to proteolysis. Hence, allergen cleavage rates are presumed to be linked to their fold stability, i.e., unfolding probability. Yet, these locally unfolded structures have neither been captured in experiment nor simulation due to limitations in resolution and sampling time, respectively. Here, we perform classic and enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify fold dynamics on extended timescales of Bet v 1a and two variants with higher and lower cleavage rates. Already at the nanosecond-timescale we observe a significantly higher flexibility for the destabilized variant compared to Bet v 1a and the proteolytically stabilized mutant. Estimating the thermodynamics and kinetics of local unfolding around an initial cleavage site, we find that the Bet v 1 variant with the highest cleavage rate also shows the highest probability for local unfolding. For the stabilized mutant on the other hand we only find minimal unfolding probability. These results strengthen the link between the conformational dynamics of allergen proteins and their stability during endolysosomal degradation. The presented approach further allows atomistic insights in the conformational ensemble of allergen proteins and provides probability estimates below experimental detection limits.","[Kamenik, Anna S.; Hofer, Florian; Handle, Philip H.; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",klaus.liedl@uibk.ac.at,,"Kamenik, Anna Sophia/0000-0001-8657-0036","Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]",This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grant P30565 and grant P30737.,,105,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-889X,,FRONT MOL BIOSCI,Front.

The gain-of-function mutation N629D at the outer mouth of the selectivity filter (SF) disrupts inactivation and K+- selective transport in hERG1, leading to arrhythmogenic phenotypes associated with long-QT syndrome. Here, we combined computational electrophysiology with Markov state model analysis to investigate how SF-level gating modalities control selective cation transport in wild-type (WT) and mutant (N629D) hERG1 variants. Starting from the recently reported cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) open-state channel structure, multiple microseconds-long molecular-dynamics (MD) trajectories were generated using different cation configurations at the filter, voltages, electrolyte concentrations, and force-field parameters. Most of the K+ permeation events observed in hERG1-WT simulations occurred at microsecond timescales, influenced by the spontaneous dehydration/rehydration dynamics at the filter. The SF region displayed conductive, constricted, occluded, and dilated states, in qualitative agreement with the well-documented flickering conductance of hERG1. In line with mutagenesis studies, these gating modalities resulted from dynamic interaction networks involving residues from the SF, outer-mouth vestibule, P-helices, and S5-P segments. We found that N629D mutation significantly stabilizes the SF in a state that is permeable to both K+ and Na+, which is reminiscent of the SF in the nonselective bacterial NaK channel. Increasing the external K+ concentration induced WT-like SF dynamics in N629D, in qualitative agreement with the recovery of flickering currents in experiments. Overall, our findings provide an understanding of themolecularmechanisms controlling selective transport in K+ channels with a nonconventional SF sequence.","[Miranda, Williams E.; Noskov, Sergei Yu.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Mol Simulat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [DeMarco, Kevin R.; Vorobyov, Igor; Clancy, Colleen E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Physiol & Membrane Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Guo, Jiqing; Duff, Henry J.] Univ Calgary, Cumming Sch Med, Libin Cardiovasc Inst Alberta, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Vorobyov, Igor; Clancy, Colleen E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pharmacol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Noskov, SY (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Mol Simulat, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.; Clancy, CE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Physiol & Membrane Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Clancy, CE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Pharmacol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ceclancy@ucdavis.edu; snoskov@ucalgary.ca,"; Vorobyov, Igor/N-2309-2014","Noskov, Sergei/0000-0001-7769-335X; Vorobyov, Igor/0000-0002-4767-5297","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [ANTON 2 PSCA16108P, PSCA17021P]; Canadian Institutes for Health Research Project Program GrantCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [FRN-CIHR 156236]; Vanier Canada Graduate scholarship; Killam scholarship; Alberta Innovates Health Solutions studentship; American Heart AssociationAmerican Heart Association [16PRE27260295, 19CDA34770101]; NIH Common FundUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [OT2-OD026580-01]; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL128537-03]; NHLBI Grant [U01HL126273-04]; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [MCB170095]; University of California, Davis, Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology Research Partnership Fund; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) [R01GM116961]","The work in S.Y.N.'s group was supported by NIH Grant R01HL128537-03); H.J.D. was supported by Canadian Institutes for Health Research Project Program Grant FRN-CIHR 156236).

In hypoxia, HIF-1 alpha binds TAZ1 to control the transcription of adaptive genes critical for the recovery from hypoxic stress. CITED2 acts as the negative feedback regulator to rapidly displace HIF-1 alpha and efficiently attenuate the hypoxic response. Though CITED2 and HIF-1 alpha have the same dissociation constant (K-d = 10 nM) in their binary complexes with TAZ1, CITED2 is much more competitive than HIF-1 alpha upon binding the same target TAZ1 in ternary (Berlow et al. Nature 2017, 543, 447-451). Here we demonstrate that a simple coarse-grained model can recapitulate this negative allosteric effect and provide detailed physical insights into the displacement mechanism. We find that long-range electrostatic forces are essential for the efficient displacement of HIF-1 alpha by CITED2. The strong electrostatic interactions between CITED2 and TAZ1, along with the unique binding mode, make CITED2 much more competitive than HIF-1 alpha in binding TAZ1.","[Wang, Yanming; Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Brooks, Charles L., III] Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Brooks, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Brooks, CL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Biophys Program, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",brookscl@umich.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 1506273],The authors acknowledge financial support from the National Science Foundation under Grant CHE 1506273.,,21,1,1,4,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7185,,,J PHYS CHEM LETT,J.

Because HDX provides a measurement of solvent exposure of backbone hydrogens, ensemble-averaged over potentially slow kinetic processes, it has been challenging to use HDX protection factors to refine structural ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. This entails dual challenges: (1) identifying structural observables that best correlate with backbone amide protection from exchange and (2) restraining these observables in molecular simulations to model ensembles consistent with experimental measurements. Here, we make significant progress on both fronts. First, we describe an improved predictor of HDX protection factors from structural observables in simulated ensembles, parametrized from ultralong molecular dynamics simulation trajectory data, with a Bayesian inference approach used to retain the full posterior distribution of model parameters. We next present a new method for obtaining simulated ensembles in agreement with experimental HDX protection factors, in which molecular simulations are performed at various temperatures and restraint biases and used to construct multiensemble Markov State Models (MSMs). Finally, the BICePs (Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations) algorithm is then used with our HDX protection factor predictor to infer which thermodynamic ensemble agrees best with the experiment and estimate populations of each conformational state in the MSM. To illustrate the approach, we use a combination of HDX protection factor restraints and chemical shift restraints to model the conformational ensemble of apomyoglobin at pH 6. The resulting ensemble agrees well with the experiment and gives insight into the all-atom structure of disordered helices F and H in the absence of heme.","[Wan, Hongbin; Ge, Yunhui; Razavi, Asghar; Voelz, Vincent A.] Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA","Voelz, VA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",voelz@temple.edu,"WAN, HONGBIN/AAH-9691-2020; Ge, Yunhui/I-1514-2018","WAN, HONGBIN/0000-0002-4875-531X; Ge, Yunhui/0000-0002-3946-1440; Voelz, Vincent/0000-0002-1054-2124","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-140270, CNS-09-58854]","The authors thank Heinrich Roder for valuable expertise and advice, Juliette Lacomte for NMR structure refinement information for sperm whale apomyoglobin at pH 7, and D.

Based on these findings and our experimental results, we propose that the divergent receptor conformations stabilized by Na+-sensitive eticlopride and Na+-insensitive risperidone correspond to different degrees of inverse agonism.

With these calculations we are able to compare thermodynamic and kinetic properties depending on the presence of Na+. For the first time, we directly observe sodium-induced conformational changes in long-timescale computer simulations. Thereby, we are able to explain the resulting change in activity. We observe a stabilization of the active form in presence of Na+ and a shift towards the inactive form in Na+-free simulations. We identify key structural features to quantify and monitor this conformational shift. These include the accessibility of the S1 pocket and the reorientation of W215, of R221a and of the Na+ loop. The structural characteristics exhibit dynamics at various timescales: Conformational changes in the Na+ binding loop constitute the slowest observed movement. Depending on its orientation, it induces conformational shifts in the nearby substrate binding site.

A promising approach to enhanced sampling of MSMs is to use adaptive methods, in which new MD trajectories are seeded preferentially from previously identified states. Here, we investigate the performance of various MSM estimators applied to reseeding trajectory data, for both a simple 1D free energy landscape and mini-protein folding MSMs ofWWdomain and NTL9(1-39).

A particularly useful strategy is to use molecular simulations as a modeling tool to interpret experimental measurements, and to use experimental data to refine our biophysical models. Thus, explicit integration and synergy between molecular simulations and experiments is fundamental for furthering our understanding of biological processes. This is especially true in the case where discrepancies between measured and simulated observables emerge. In this chapter, we provide an overview of some of the core ideas behind methods that were developed to improve the consistency between experimental information and numerical predictions. We distinguish between situations where experiments are used to refine our understanding and models of specific systems, and situations where experiments are used more generally to refine transferable models. We discuss different philosophies and attempt to unify them in a single framework. Until now, such integration between experiments and simulations have mostly been applied to equilibrium data, and we discuss more recent developments aimed to analyze time-dependent or time-resolved data.","[Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr; Bottaro, Sandro; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr; Bottaro, Sandro; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Orioli, Simone; Larsen, Andreas Haahr] Univ Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Inst, Struct Biophys, Fac Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bottaro, Sandro] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Atomist Simulat Lab, Genoa, Italy; [Larsen, Andreas Haahr] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Struct Bioinformat & Computat Biochem Unit, Oxford, England","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Copenhagen, Denmark.; Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Dept Biol, Copenhagen, Denmark.",lindorff@bio.ku.dk,"Larsen, Andreas Haahr/P-5655-2015","Larsen, Andreas Haahr/0000-0002-2230-2654",Lundbeck FoundationLundbeckfonden; NordForsk Nordic Neutron Science Programme; Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation; Velux Foundations; Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk Foundation,"We acknowledge support by a grant from the Lundbeck Foundation to the BRAINSTRUC structural biology initiative, the NordForsk Nordic Neutron Science Programme, the Carlsberg Foundation, a grant from the Velux Foundations and a Hallas-Moller Stipend from the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

It can also be used to calculate the free energy landscapes of the conformational transitions to better understand the functions of the biomolecules. However, the sampling of biomolecular configurations is limited by the free energy barriers that need to be overcome, leading to considerable gaps between the timescales reached by MD simulation and those governing biological processes. To address this issue, many enhanced sampling methodologies have been developed to increase the sampling efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. Usually, enhanced sampling algorithms can be classified into methods based on collective variables (CV-based) and approaches which do not require predefined CVs (CV-free). In this chapter, the theoretical basis of free energy estimation is briefly reviewed first, followed by the reviews of the most common CV-based and CV-free methods including the presentation of some examples and recent developments.

Therefore, structural and functional characterization, in particular of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), is crucial to the design and engineering of antibodies with unique binding properties. Various studies have focused on classifying the CDR loops into a small set of main-chain conformations to facilitate antibody design by assuming that certain sequences can only adopt a limited number of conformations. Here, we present a kinetic classification of CDR loop structures as ensembles in solution. Using molecular dynamics simulations in combination with strong experimental structural information, we observe conformational transitions between canonical clusters and additional dominant solution structures in the micro-to-millisecond timescale for all CDR loops, independent of length and sequence composition. Besides identifying all relevant conformations in solution, our results revealed that various canonical cluster medians actually belong to the same kinetic minimum. Additionally, we reconstruct the kinetics and probabilities of the conformational transitions between canonical clusters, and thereby extend the model of static canonical structures to reveal a dynamic conformational ensemble in solution as a new paradigm in the field of antibody structure design.","[Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,,,"Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]",This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grant [P30565 and P30737].,,71,3,3,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1942-0862,1942-0870,,MABS-AUSTIN,mAbs,JAN 1,2020,12,1,,,,,,,1744328,10.1080/19420862.2020.1744328,,,11,"Medicine, Research & Experimental",Research & Experimental Medicine,LE0NA,WOS:000526420500001,32264741,"Other Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

We use the local kernels introduced by Berry and Sauer, but allow for arbitrary sampling densities.

Normally, the free energy perturbation (FEP) method provides an appropriate result. However, it is of great interest to improve the accuracy and precision of this method. In this context, temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics implementation of the FEP computational approach, which we call replica exchange free energy perturbation (REP) was proposed. In particular, during REP simulations, the system can easily escape from being trapped in local minima by exchanging configurations with high temperatures, resulting in significant improvement in the accuracy and precision of protein-ligand binding affinity calculations. The distribution of the decoupling free energy was enlarged, and its mean values were decreased. This results in changes in the magnitude of the calculated binding free energies as well as in alteration in the binding mechanism. Moreover, the REP correlation coefficient with respect to experiment (R-REP = 0.85 +/- 0.15) is significantly boosted in comparison with the FEP one (R-FEP = 0.64 +/- 0.30). Furthermore, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of REP is also smaller than FEP, RMSEREP = 4.28 +/- 0.69 versus RMSEFEP = 5.80 +/- 1.11 kcal/mol, respectively.

To obtain a broader view of dynamics, typically one needs to launch many such simulations, obtaining many trajectories. A summarization of the equilibrium dynamics requires integrating the information in the various trajectories, and Markov State Models (MSM) are increasingly being used for this task. At its core, the task involves organizing the structures accessed in simulation into structural states, and then constructing a transition probability matrix revealing the transitions between states. While now considered a mature technology and widely used to summarize equilibrium dynamics, the underlying computational process in the construction of an MSM ignores energetics even though the transition of a molecule between two nearby structures in an MD trajectory is governed by the corresponding energies. In this paper, we connect theory with simulation and analysis of equilibrium dynamics. A molecule navigates the energy landscape underlying the structure space. The structural states that are identified via off-the-shelf clustering algorithms need to be connected to thermody-namically-stable and semi-stable (macro)states among which transitions can then be quantified. Leveraging recent developments in the analysis of energy landscapes that identify basins in the landscape, we evaluate the hypothesis that basins, directly tied to stable and semi-stable states, lead to better models of dynamics. Our analysis indicates that basins lead to MSMs of better quality and thus can be useful to further advance this widely-used technology for summarization of molecular equilibrium dynamics.","[Kabir, Kazi Lutful; Akhter, Nasrin] George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Shehu, Amarda] George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Bioengn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Shehu, A (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Syst Biol, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Bioengn, 4400 Univ Dr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",kkabir@gmu.edu; nakhter3@gmu.edu; amarda@gmu.edu,,,"NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1440581, 1821154]; Jeffress Memorial Trust Award","This work is supported in part by the NSF Grant Nos. 1440581 and 1821154, and a Jeffress Memorial Trust Award.

Studies suggest that TTR aggregation is initiated by a rate-limiting dissociation of the homo-tetramer into its monomers, which can rapidly misfold and self-assemble into amyloid fibril. Thus, exploring conformational change involved in TTR monomer misfolding is of vital importance for understanding the pathogenesis of ATTR amyloidosis. In this work, microsecond timescale hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Markov state model (MSM) analysis were performed to investigate the misfolding mechanism of the TTR monomer. The results indicate that a macrostate with partially unfolded conformations may serve as the misfolded state of the TTR monomer. This misfolded state was extremely stable with a very large equilibrium probability of about 85.28%. With secondary structure analysis, we found the DAGH sheet in this state to be significantly destroyed. The CBEF sheet was relatively stable and sheet structure was maintained. However, the F-strand in this sheet was likely to move away from E-strand and reform a new beta-sheet with the H-strand. This observation is consistent with experimental finding that F and H strands in the outer edge drive the misfolding of TTR. Finally, transition pathways from a near native state to this misfolded macrostate showed that the conformational transition can occur either through a native-like beta-sheet intermediates or through partially unfolded intermediates, while the later appears to be the main pathway.

Tau dysfunction is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies, which are characterized by neurofibrillary tangles formed by abnormally aggregated tau protein. Studying the aggregation mechanism of tau protein is of great significance for elucidating the etiology of tauopathies. The hexapeptide (306)VQIVYK(311) (PHF6) of R3 has been shown to play a vital role in promoting tau aggregation. In this study, long-term all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent were performed to investigate the mechanisms of spontaneous aggregation and template-induced misfolding of PHF6, and the dimerization at the early stage of nucleation was further specifically analyzed by the Markov state model (MSM). Our results show that PHF6 can spontaneously aggregate to form multimers enriched with beta-sheet structure and the beta-sheets in multimers prefer to exist in a parallel way. It is observed that PHF6 monomer can be induced to form a beta-sheet structure on either side of the template but in a different way. In detail, the beta-sheet structure is easier to form on the left side but does not extend well, but on the right side, the monomer can form the extended beta-sheet structure. Furthermore, MSM analysis shows that the formation of dimer mainly occurs in three steps. First, the separated monomers collide with each other at random orientations, and then a dimer with short beta-sheet structure at the N-terminal forms; finally, beta-sheets elongate to form an extended parallel beta-sheet dimer. During these processes, multiple intermediate states are identified and multiple paths can form a parallel beta-sheet dimer from the disordered coil structure. Moreover, the residues 1308, V309, and Y310 play an essential role in the dimerization. In a word, our results uncover the aggregation and misfolding mechanism of PHF6 from the atomic level, which can provide useful theoretical guidance for rational design of effective therapeutic drugs against tauopathies.","[Liu, Hongli; Zhou, Shuangyan; Tan, Shuoyan; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Haiyang; Liu, Xuewei; Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Haiyang; Liu, Xuewei; Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, Dept Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuangyan] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Chongqing Key Lab Big Data Bio Intelligence, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macau Inst Appl Res Med & Hlth, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",hxliu@lzu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Huanxiang/0000-0002-9284-3667","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21973035, 21675070]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21973035 and 21675070).,,64,1,1,3,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7193,,,ACS CHEM NEUROSCI,ACS Chem.

Class A beta-lactamases are structurally and functionally related to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Despite the extensive studies of the structures, catalytic mechanisms and dynamics of both beta-lactamases and PBPs, the potentially different dynamical behaviors of these proteins in different functional states still remain elusive in general. In this study, four evolutionarily related proteins, including TEM-1 and TOHO-1 as class A beta-lactamases, PBP-A and DD-transpeptidase as two PBPs, are subjected to molecular dynamics simulations and various analyses to characterize their dynamical behaviors in different functional states. Penicillin G and its ring opening product serve as common ligands for these four proteins of interest. The dynamic analyses of overall structures, the active sites with penicillin G, and three catalytically important residues commonly shared by all four proteins reveal unexpected cross similarities between Class A beta-lactamases and PBPs. These findings shed light on both the hidden relations among dynamical behaviors of these proteins and the functional and evolutionary relations among class A beta-lactamases and PBPs.","[Wang, Feng; Zhou, Hongyu; Tao, Peng] Southern Methodist Univ, CD4, Ctr Sci Computat, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Wang, Xinlei] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Dallas, TX 75275 USA","Tao, P (corresponding author), Southern Methodist Univ, CD4, Ctr Sci Computat, Dept Chem, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",fengw@smu.edu; hongyuz@smu.edu; swang@smu.edu; ptao@smu.edu,"Tao, Peng/H-4925-2014; Wang, Feng/Q-6884-2017","Tao, Peng/0000-0002-2488-0239; Wang, Feng/0000-0001-7808-7538",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1753167],This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (1753167).,,71,2,2,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,NOV,2019,21,11,,,,,,,1130,10.3390/e21111130,,,26,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Physics,JV1QZ,WOS:000502145000103,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-11-19,

This work quantitatively assesses the quality of four popular carbohydrate force fields (CHARMM36, GLYCAM06, OPLS-AA, GROMOS53A6(CARBO_R))( )against their ability to accurately model the conformational landscape of a dodecamer of single-stranded amylose, the key constituent of starch. While past NMR and X-ray studies have hinted at evidence of a helical structure of amylose and its spontaneous helix-coil transition, it remains to be seen how existing force fields fare against modeling its structural transition. Toward this end, we perform a multimicrosecond long extensive molecular dynamics simulation of dodecamer of a single-stranded amylose chain in explicit water in each of the four force fields and assess these force fields' ability to model relative structural transitions via analyzing the radius of gyration, glycosidic linkage orientation, and pyranose ring puckering of the amylose. In particular, the simulations show that while GLYCAMO6 and CHARMM36 force fields predict a significant helix-coil transition in the amylose, GROMOS53A6(CARBO_R) and OPLS-AA majorly favor extended conformation. The Markov State Model (MSM), built using the simulation trajectories, for each force field, provides a comparative quantification of the population of key macrostates of amylose and elucidates an underlying network of pathways of their mutual interconversion. The macrostates obtained from MSM revealed that metastable helixlike and semicoil intermediate conformations are more probable for CHARMM36, whereas elongated or helixlike conformations are more probable in OPLS-AA and GROMOS53A6(CARBO_R). GLYCAMO6 showed significant probability for both helix and coil conformations along with intermediate conformations. We find that the differences in the conformations across force fields are governed by differences in the kinetics of glycosidic linkages and pyranose ring pucker conformers. All four force fields share one common point that the majority of alpha(1 -> 4) glycosidic linkages preferred syn conformation, which is found to be energetically more favorable than anti. However, except for GROMOS53A6(CARBO_R), all other force fields predicted non-negligible minor anti conformation. The multimicrosecond long simulations on the single-chain amylose, in combination with MSM, described here, suggest that sampling of alpha(1 -> 4) linked oligosacharides on microsecond time scales enable quantitative predictions of helix-coil, glycosidic linkage, and pyranose ring exchange kinetics. These exchange kinetics have otherwise remained inaccessible to quantification by experiments or nanosecond time scale simulations which might have hindered the comparison of the possibility of helix-coil exchange across different force fields on equal footing.","[Koneru, Jaya Krishna; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, India; [Zhu, Xiao] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Res Comp, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, India.; Zhu, X (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Res Comp, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",zhu472@purdue.edu; jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,,"TIFR, India; Department of Science and Technology (DST) of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [ECR/2016/000672]; XSEDE [CHE160057]","The current work was enabled by computing facilities developed using intramural research grants received from TIFR, India, Ramanujan Fellowship and Early Career Research funds provided by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of India (ECR/2016/000672).

Thus, an accurate characterization of local fluctuations may be important for modeling the kinetic mechanism that leads to the biological activity of a protein. In this paper, we study the fluctuation dynamics of the regulatory protein ubiquitin and propose a novel theoretical approach to model its fluctuations. A coarse-grained, diffusive, mode-dependent description of fluctuations is accomplished using the Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics (LE4PD). This equation decomposes the dynamics of a protein, simulated by molecular dynamics, into dynamical pathways that explore mode-dependent free energy surfaces. We calculate the time scales of the slow, high-amplitude fluctuations by modeling the kinetics of barrier crossing in the two-dimensional free energy surfaces using Markov state modeling. We find that the LE4PD predicts slow fluctuations in three important binding regions in ubiquitin: the C-terminal tail, the LysI 1 loop, and the 50 s loop. These results suggest that the LE4PD can provide useful information on the role of fluctuations in the process of molecular recognition regulating the biological activity of ubiquitin.

We address this question by introducing a back-mapping based sampling (BMBS) that combines multiple aspects of different sampling techniques. BMBS uses coarse grained (CG) free energy surfaces (FESs) and dimensionality reduction to initiate new atomistic simulations. These new simulations are started from atomistic conformations that were back-mapped from CG points all over the FES in order to sample the entire accessible phase space as fast as possible. In the context of BMBS, we address relevant back-mapping related questions like where to start the back-mapping from and how to judge the atomistic ensemble that results from the BMBS. The latter is done with the use of the earth mover's distance, which allows us to quantitatively compare distributions of CG and atomistic ensembles. By using this metric, we can also show that the BMBS is able to correct inaccuracies of the CG model. In this paper, BMBS is applied to a just recently introduced neural network (NN) based approach for a radical coarse graining to predict free energy surfaces for oligopeptides. The BMBS scheme back-maps these FESs to the atomistic scale, justifying and complementing the proposed NN based CG approach. The efficiency benefit of the algorithm scales with the length of the oligomer. Already for the heptamers, the algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster in sampling compared to a standard MD simulation.

In this article, we provide a convenient and user-friendly tool that is compatible to AMBER, called fast sampling and analysis tool (FSATOOL). FSATOOL has some useful features. First and the most important, the whole work is extremely simplified into two steps, one is the fast sampling procedure and the other is the trajectory analysis procedure. Second, it contains several powerful sampling methods for the simulation on graphics process unit, including our previous mixing replica exchange molecular dynamics method. The method combines the advantages of the biased and unbiased simulations. Finally, it extracts the dominant transition pathways automatically from the folding network by Markov state model. Users do not need to do the tedious intermediate steps by hand. To illustrate the usage of FSATOOL in practice, we perform one simulation for a RNA hairpin in explicit solvent. All the results are presented.

The functions of the human guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1) are tightly coupled to GTP hydrolysis and dimerization. Despite known crystal structures of the hGBP1 monomer and GTPase domain dimer, little is known about the dynamics of hGBP1. To gain a mechanistic understanding of hGBP1, we performed sub-millisecond multi-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of both the hGBP1 monomer and dimer. We found that hGBP1 is a highly flexible protein that undergoes a hinge motion similar to the movements observed for other dynamin-like proteins. Another large-scale motion was observed for the C-terminal helix alpha 13, providing a molecular view for the alpha 13-alpha 13 distances previously reported for the hGBP1 dimer. Most of the loops of the GTPase domain were found to be flexible, revealing why GTP binding is needed for hGBP1 dimerization to occur. Author summary Guanylate binding proteins are key fighters against microbial and viral pathogens. In the human body there are seven types of such proteins, among which is the guanylate binding protein 1 (hGBP1). This protein is able to perform its function only once it is activated by binding and converting guanosine triphosphat (GTP) to guanosine diphosphat and guanosine monophosphat via hydrolysis. In concert with the conversion of GTP the dimerization of hGBP1 occurs, which can further interact with the lipid membrane of the pathogen and disrupt it. While the crystal structure of the protein is known, the activation and dimerization steps are not well understood at molecular level as studying them experimentally is difficult. An alternative approach is given by molecular simulations, allowing us to elucidate the protein dynamics closely connected to these steps. From our simulations applied to both the hGBP1 monomer and dimer we identified large-scale motions taking place in hGBP1 that had not been reported before. We discuss the relevance of these motions in terms of their biological function, such as possible membrane damage caused by one of the motions or locking the protein in the dimer state.","[Barz, Bogdan] Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Phys Biol, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Loschwitz, Jennifer; Strodel, Birgit] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Complex Syst Struct Biochem, Julich, Germany; [Loschwitz, Jennifer; Strodel, Birgit] Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Dusseldorf, Germany","Strodel, B (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Complex Syst Struct Biochem, Julich, Germany.; Strodel, B (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Dusseldorf, Germany.",b.strodel@fz-juelich.de,"Strodel, Birgit/H-5449-2013","Strodel, Birgit/0000-0002-8734-7765","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [267205415, CRC 1208, INST 208/704-1 FUGG, JICS6A]","BS received funding for this project from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation, http://www.dfg.de/) through grant number 267205415 (CRC 1208, project A07) and through INST 208/704-1 FUGG to purchase the hybrid computer cluster used in this study.

Using an aggregate of nearly 1 mu s of unbiased all-atom implicit membrane and solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we identified distinct structural states of the NMDA receptor and revealed functionally important residues (GluN1/Glu522, GluN1/Arg695, and GluN2B/Asp786). The role of the clamshell motion of the ligand binding domain (LBD) lobes in the structural transition is supplemented by the observed structural similarity at the level of protein domains during the structural transition, combined with the overall large rearrangement necessary for the opening and closing of the receptor. The activated and open states of the receptor are structurally similar to the liganded crystal structure, while in the unliganded receptor the extracellular domains perform rearrangements leading to a clockwise rotation of up to 45 degrees around the longitudinal axis of the receptor, which closes the ion channel. The ligand-induced rotation of extracellular domains transferred by LBD-TMD linkers to the membrane-anchored ion channel is responsible for the opening and closing of the transmembrane ion channel, revealing the properties of NMDA receptor as a finely tuned molecular machine.","[Cerny, Jiri; Balik, Ales; Vyklicky, Ladislav] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Physiol, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220, Czech Republic; [Cerny, Jiri; Bozikova, Paulina] Czech Acad Sci, BIOCEV, Inst Biotechnol, Prumyslova 595, Vestec 25250, Prague West, Czech Republic; [Marques, Sergio M.] Masaryk Univ, Loschmidt Labs, Dept Expt Biol, Kamenice 5-A13, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Marques, Sergio M.] Masaryk Univ, RECETOX, Kamenice 5-A13, Brno 62500, Czech Republic; [Marques, Sergio M.] St Annes Univ Hosp Brno, Int Ctr Clin Res, Pekarska 53, Brno 65691, Czech Republic","Cerny, J; Vyklicky, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Physiol, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220, Czech Republic.; Cerny, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, BIOCEV, Inst Biotechnol, Prumyslova 595, Vestec 25250, Prague West, Czech Republic.",jiri.cerny@ibt.cas.cz; Paulina.Bozikova@ibt.cas.cz; ales.balik@fgu.cas.cz; smar96@gmail.com; Ladislav.Vyklicky@fgu.cas.cz,"Marques, Sergio M/H-8685-2012; Vyklicky, Ladislav/C-1851-2012; Balik, Ales/C-1900-2012; Cerny, Jiri/I-4733-2012","Marques, Sergio M/0000-0002-6281-7505; Vyklicky, Ladislav/0000-0002-0015-0098; Balik, Ales/0000-0002-7059-6095; Cerny, Jiri/0000-0002-1969-9304",Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-02300S]; Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TN01000013]; European Regional Development Fund Projects (PharmaBrain)European Union (EU) [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007444]; InstitutionalResearchProjects of the Institute ofBiotechnology [RVO 86652036]; Institute of Physiology [RVO 67985823],"This research was funded by the Czech Science Foundation (17-02300S), Technology Agency of the Czech Republic (TN01000013), European Regional Development Fund Projects (PharmaBrain CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007444) and Biotechnology and Biomedicine Centre of Academy of Sciences and Charles University inVestec (BIOCEVCZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0109), andInstitutionalResearchProjects of the Institute ofBiotechnology (RVO 86652036) and the Institute of Physiology (RVO 67985823).

However, several challenges remain in designing a protein sequence such that the binding site organization results in high affinity interaction with a bound ligand. Here, we study the dynamics of explicitly solvated designed proteins through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain insight into the causes that lead to the low affinity or instability of most of these designs, despite the prediction of their success by the computational design methodology. Simulations ranging from 500 to 1000 ns per replicate were conducted on 37 designed protein variants encompassing two distinct folds and a range of ligand affinities, resulting in more than 180 mu s of combined sampling. The simulations provide retrospective insights into the properties affecting ligand affinity that can prove useful in guiding further steps of design optimization. Features indicate that entropic components are particularly important for affinity, which are not easily incorporated in the empirical models often used in design protocols. Additionally, we demonstrate that the application of machine learning approaches built upon the output from the simulations can help discriminate between successful and failed binders, such that MD could act as a screening step in protein design, resulting in a more efficient process.","[Barros, Emilia P.; Amaro, Rommie E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Amaro, Rommie E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Biomed Computat Resource, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Schiffer, Jamie M.] Janssen Pharmaceut Inc, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Vorobieva, Anastassia; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Vorobieva, Anastassia; Dou, Jiayi; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Dou, Jiayi] Stanford Univ, Dept Bioengn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Amaro, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Amaro, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Natl Biomed Computat Resource, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ramaro@ucsd.edu,,"Schiffer, Jamie/0000-0002-0208-6958",National Biomedical Computation Resource (NBCR) through NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41 GM103426],This work was funded in part by the National Biomedical Computation Resource (NBCR) through NIH P41 GM103426.,,64,4,4,10,34,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In molecular dynamics simulations, these data-driven collective variables capture the slowest modes of the dynamics and are useful for enhanced sampling and free energy estimation. In this work, we employ SRV coordinates as a feature set for Markov state model (MSM) construction. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, MSMs constructed from SRV coordinates are more robust to the choice of input features, exhibit faster implied time scale convergence, and permit the use of shorter lagtimes to construct higher kinetic resolution models. We apply this methodology to study the folding kinetics and conformational landscape of the Trp-cage miniprotein. Folding and unfolding mean first passage times are in good agreement with the prior literature, and a nine macrostate model is presented. The unfolded ensemble comprises a central kinetic hub with interconversions to several metastable unfolded conformations and which serves as the gateway to the folded ensemble. The folded ensemble comprises the native state, a partially unfolded intermediate loop state, and a previously unreported short-lived intermediate that we were able to resolve due to the high time resolution of the SRV-MSM. We propose SRVs as an excellent candidate for integration into modern MSM construction pipelines.","[Sidky, Hythem; Ferguson, Andrew L.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chen, Wei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ferguson, AL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",andrewferguson@uchicago.edu,,"Ferguson, Andrew/0000-0002-8829-9726",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1841805]; Molecular Software Sciences Institute (MolSSI) Software Fellows program (NSF grant) [ACI1547580],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CHE-1841805.

To shed light on the underlying mechanism and atomic basis of this process, we carried out a comparative investigation of the oncogenic G12D K-Ras mutant and its phosphorylated variant (pTyr32) using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state models. We show that, despite sharing a number of common features, G12D and pTyr32-G12D K-Ras exhibit some distinct conformational states and fluctuations. In addition to notable differences in conformation and dynamics of residues surrounding the GTP binding site, nonlocal changes were observed at a number of loops. Switch I is more flexible in pTyr32-G12D K-Ras while switch II is more flexible in G12D K-Ras. We also used time-lagged independent component analysis and k-means clustering to identify five metastable states for each system. We utilized transition path theory to calculate the transition probabilities for each state to build a Markov state model for each system.

Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.","[Noe, Frank; Olsson, Simon; Koehler, Jonas; Wu, Hao] FU Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Noe, Frank] FU Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 14, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Noe, Frank] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wu, Hao] Tongji Univ, Sch Math Sci, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Noe, F (corresponding author), FU Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F (corresponding author), FU Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 14, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019","Olsson, Simon/0000-0002-3927-7897; Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324; Kohler, Jonas/0000-0002-7256-2892","European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERC CoG 772230]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC1114/A04, GRK2433 DAEDALUS]; MATH+ Berlin Mathematics Research Center [AA1x8, EF1x2]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","We acknowledge funding from the European Commission (ERC CoG 772230 ScaleCell), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (CRC1114/A04, GRK2433 DAEDALUS), the MATH+ Berlin Mathematics Research Center (AA1x8, EF1x2), and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (postdoctoral fellowship to S.O.)",,52,47,47,18,51,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,SEP 6,2019,365,6457,,,,,1001,+,eaaw1147,10.1126/science.aaw1147,,,30,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,IW1MK,WOS:000484732700040,31488660,,,,2020-11-19,

We analyzed four series of antibody binding fragments (Fabs) and a variable fragment (Fv) with structural information in different stages of humanization to investigate the influence of the framework, point mutations and specificity on the complementarity determining region (CDR)-H3 loop dynamics. We also studied a Fv without structural information of the anti-idiotypic antibody Ab2/3H6, because it completely lost its binding affinity upon superhumanization, as an example of a failed humanization. Enhanced sampling techniques in combination with molecular dynamics simulations allow to access micro- to milli-second timescales of the CDR-H3 loop dynamics and reveal kinetic and thermodynamic changes involved in the process of humanization. In most cases, we observe a reduced conformational diversity of the CDR-H3 loop when grafted on a human framework and find a conformational shift of the dominant CDR-H3 loop conformation in solution. A shallow side minimum of the conformational CDR-H3 loop ensemble attached to the murine framework becomes the dominant conformation in solution influenced by the human framework. Additionally, we observe in the case of the failed humanization that the potentially binding competent murine CDR-H3 loop ensemble in solution shows nearly no kinetical or structural overlap with the superhumanized variant, thus explaining the loss of binding.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Heiss, Martin C.; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Ctr Mol Biosci Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,,,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565],This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grant P30565.,,83,3,3,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1741-0126,1741-0134,,PROTEIN ENG DES SEL,Protein Eng.

For weak binding compounds typically identified in fragment-based screening (FBS) campaigns, determination of the correct binding site and correct binding mode is usually done experimentally via X-ray crystallography. For many targets of pharmaceutical interest, however, establishing an X-ray system which allows for sufficient throughput to support a drug discovery project is not possible. In this case, exploration of fragment hits becomes a very laborious and consequently slow process with the generation of protein/ligand cocrystal structures as the bottleneck of the entire process. In this work, we introduce a computational method which is able to reliably predict binding sites and binding modes of fragment-like small molecules using solely the structure of the apoprotein and the ligand's chemical structure as input information. The method is based on molecular dynamics simulations and Markov-state models and can be run as a fully automated protocol requiring minimal human intervention. We describe the application of the method to a representative subset of different target classes and fragments from historical FBS efforts at Boehringer Ingelheim and discuss its potential integration into the overall fragment-based drug discovery workflow.","[Linker, Stephanie Maria; Magarkar, Aniket; Seeliger, Daniel] Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Dept Med Chem, Birkendorfer Str 65, D-88397 Biberach, Germany; [Linker, Stephanie Maria; Koefinger, Juergen; Hummer, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hummer, Gerhard] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Seeliger, D (corresponding author), Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Dept Med Chem, Birkendorfer Str 65, D-88397 Biberach, Germany.",daniel.seeliger@boehringer-ingelheim.com,"Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013","Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X; Seeliger, Daniel/0000-0002-4119-6068; Kofinger, Jurgen/0000-0001-8367-1077",,,,35,4,4,1,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

These structures identify the four-helix bundle that serves as the interface for formation of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase dimers. Here we performed a theoretical comparison of the structural and energetic factors governing dimerization. This included identification of inter-subunit and infra-subunit hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, evaluation of solvent-accessible surfaces, and estimation of electrostatic contributions to dimerization. To reveal the contribution to dimerization of individual amino acids within the contact area, free energy perturbation alanine screening was performed. Markov state modelling shows that the loop between the alpha 13 and alpha 14 helices in BChE is unstable, and occupies 4 macro-states. The order of magnitude of mean first passage times between these macrostates is similar to 10(-8)s. Replica exchange molecular dynamics umbrella sampling calculations revealed that the free energy of human BChE dimerization is -15.5 kcal/mol, while that for human AChE is - 26.4 kcal/mol. Thus, the C-terminally truncated human butyrylcholinesterase dimer is substantially less stable than that of human acetylcholinesterase.

In recent years, Markov state models have gained immense popularity for computing state-to-state dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the assumption that the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian induces a systematic bias in the model, especially in biomolecular systems with complicated energy landscapes. To address this problem, we have devised a new approach we call quasistationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC) that gives accurate long time state-to-state evolution while retaining the entire time resolution even when the dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The proposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes advantage of two concepts: (i) the quasistationary distribution, the distribution that results when a trajectory remains in one state for a long time (the dephasing time), such that the next escape is Markovian, and (ii) dynamical corrections theory, which properly accounts for the correlated events that occur as a trajectory passes from state to state before it settles again. In practice, this is achieved by specifying, for each escape, the intermediate states and the final state that has resulted from the escape. Implementation of QSD-KMC imposes stricter requirements on the lengths of the trajectories than in a Markov state model approach as the trajectories must be long enough to dephase. However, the QSD-KMC model produces state-to-state trajectories that are statistically indistinguishable from an MD trajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states for an arbitrary choice of state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to construct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of the initial choice of states. We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two one-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven nonequilibrium system, and on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.","[Agarwal, Animesh; Hengartner, Nicolas W.; Gnanakaran, S.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Voter, Arthur F.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Div T 1, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA","Gnanakaran, S (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",gnana@lanl.gov; afv@lanl.gov,,,Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program; National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Energy by the Argonne National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06-CH11357]; Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory [DE-AC5206NA25396]; Oak Ridge National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research [HHSN261200800001E],"This work has been supported in part by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health.

Previously we used ancestral reconstruction to determine how CMGC group kinase specificity evolved (Howard et al., 2014). In the present study, we reconstructed ancestral kinases to study the evolution of regulation, from the inferred ancestor of CDKs and MAPKs, to modern ERKs. Kinases switched from high to low autophosphorylation activity at the transition to the inferred ancestor of ERKs 1 and 2. Two synergistic amino acid changes were sufficient to induce this change: shortening of the beta 3-alpha C loop and mutation of the gatekeeper residue. Restoring these two mutations to their inferred ancestral state led to a loss of dependence of modern ERKs 1 and 2 on the upstream activating kinase MEK in human cells. Our results shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms that led to the tight regulation of a kinase that is central in development and disease.","[Sang, Dajun; Pinglay, Sudarshan; Holt, Liam J.] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, Inst Syst Genet, New York, NY 10016 USA;

Although SAA isoforms share a high degree of homology, only the SAA1.1 isoform is found in amyloid deposits. SAA1.1 misfolding is a nucleation-dependent process with dimer and trimer formation playing a major role in SAA fibril formation through self-catalyzed recruitment of native SAA molecules. Yet, a structural model of initial SAA oligomerization is still missing. In this study, we constructed a loosely associated model for murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimers in the presence or absence of hyaluronic acid as an exemplary glycosaminoglycan, a factor known to facilitate SAA fibril formation. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that hyaluronic acid finally stabilized in a different binding pocket of the pathogenic SAA1.1 dimer compared to the nonpathogenic SAA2.2 dimer. Besides, Markov state modeling points to dynamic behavioral differences between the linker region of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 and identifies a state unique to pathogenic SAA1.1 while bound to hyaluronic acid. The presence or absence of hyaluronic acid, as well as the dimer interface switch, affects dynamic behavior and possible oligomeric states, proposing a conceivable clue to the deviant pathogenicity of the two SAA isoforms.","[Jin, Lu; Syrovets, Tatiana; Simmet, Thomas] Ulm Univ, Inst Pharmacol Nat Prod & Clin Pharmacol, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Scheller, Judith S.] Ulm Univ, Inst Physiol Chem, Albert Einstein Allee 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Zhang, Xinlei] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Med Chem, Xian 710032, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Simmet, T (corresponding author), Ulm Univ, Inst Pharmacol Nat Prod & Clin Pharmacol, Helmholtzstr 20, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",thomas.simmet@uni-ulm.de,,,State of Baden Wurttemberg through the High Performance Computing Program (bwHPC); Chinese Scholarships Council [201708080165],The authors acknowledge support by the State of Baden Wurttemberg through the High Performance Computing Program (bwHPC) and by the Chinese Scholarships Council (No. 201708080165).,,50,2,2,0,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2470-1343,,,ACS OMEGA,ACS Omega,AUG,2019,4,8,,,,,13388,13399,,10.1021/acsomega.9b01590,,,12,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,IU2JY,WOS:000483407600044,31460467,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

Mechanistic and structural insights into conformational transitions underlying the Ras deactivation pathway provide opportunities for the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of Ras-driven cancers. It remains challenging, however, to completely capture a large-scale conformational transition by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we carry out a computational scheme that combines a transition pathway generation algorithm, extensive MD simulations, and Markov state model analysis for disclosing the conformational landscape of the Ras deactivation pathway. Our findings suggest a stepwise deactivation pathway for Ras hydrolysis and identify several key conformational substates along the deactivation pathway. Furthermore, we discover an unexplored and potentially allosteric binding site on the effector-binding region of Ras in the conformational substates, which is further supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. This site could be exploited to the design of Ras inhibitors to block Ras-effector interactions.","[Lu, Shaoyong; Ni, Duan; Wang, Chengxiang; He, Xinheng; Zhang, Jian] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Clin & Fundamental Res Ctr, Key Lab Cell Differentiat & Apoptosis, Chinese Minist Educ,Dept Pharm,Renji Hosp,Sch Med, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China; [Lin, Houwen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Oncogenes & Related Genes, Res Ctr Marine Drugs, Dept Pharm,Renji Hosp,Sch Med, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Gastrointestinal Surg, Renji Hosp, Sch Med, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China","Lu, SY; Zhang, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Clin & Fundamental Res Ctr, Key Lab Cell Differentiat & Apoptosis, Chinese Minist Educ,Dept Pharm,Renji Hosp,Sch Med, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China.; Wang, Z (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Gastrointestinal Surg, Renji Hosp, Sch Med, Shanghai 200127, Peoples R China.",lushaoyong@yeah.net; wangzh1972@126.com; jian.zhang@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Ni, Duan/0000-0002-3902-2843; He, Xinheng/0000-0001-7813-5480; Lu, Shaoyong/0000-0002-1334-6292; Zhang, Jian/0000-0002-6558-791X; Lin, Hou-Wen/0000-0002-7097-0876","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21778037, 81603023, 81322046, 81473137]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education CommissionInnovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [2019-01-07-00-01-E00036]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21778037, 81603023, 81322046, 81473137) and the Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission (2019-01-07-00-01-E00036).",,56,12,12,4,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2155-5435,,,ACS CATAL,ACS Catal.,AUG,2019,9,8,,,,,7188,7196,,10.1021/acscatal.9b02556,,,17,"Chemistry, Physical",Chemistry,IQ1IO,WOS:000480503700059,,,,,2020-11-19,

It has been shown that the wall teichoic acid (WTA) may be an important drug target acting on antibiotic-resistant cells. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, MnaA, is one of the first enzymes on the pathway for the biosynthesis of the WTA. Here, detailed molecular dynamics simulations of S. aureus MnaA were used to characterize the conformational changes that occur in the presence of UDP and UDP-GlcNac and also the energetic landscape associated with these changes. Using different simulation techniques, such as ABMD and GAMD, it was possible to assess the energetic profile for the protein with and without ligands in its active site. We found that there is a dynamic energy landscape that has its minimum changed by the presence of the ligands, with a closed structure of the enzyme being more frequently observed for the bound state while the unbound enzyme favors an opened conformation. Further structural analysis indicated that positively charged amino acids associated with UDP and UDP-GlcNac interactions play a major role in the enzyme opening movement. Finally, the energy landscape profiled in this work provides important conclusions for the design of inhibitor candidates targeting S. aureus MnaA.","[de Azevedo, Erika Chang; Nascimento, Alessandro S.] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Fis Sao Carlos, Av Trabalhador SaoCarlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil","Nascimento, AS (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Fis Sao Carlos, Av Trabalhador SaoCarlense 400, BR-13566590 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",asnascimento@ifsc.usp.br,,,"Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2017/18173-0, 2015/26722-8, 2015/13684-0]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [30316S/2018-9]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001]","We thank the fruitful contributions made by prof.

For molecular simulation, coarse-graining bears the promise of finding simplified models such that long-time simulations of large-scale systems become computationally tractable. While significant progress has been made in tuning thermodynamic properties of reduced models, it remains a key challenge to ensure that relevant kinetic properties are retained by coarse-grained dynamical systems. In this study, we focus on data-driven methods to preserve the rare-event kinetics of the original system and make use of their close connection to the low-lying spectrum of the system's generator. Building on work by Crommelin and Vanden-Eijnden [Multiscale Model. Simul. 9, 1588 (2011)], we present a general framework, called spectral matching, which directly targets the generator's leading eigenvalue equations when learning parameters for coarse-grained models. We discuss different parametric models for effective dynamics and derive the resulting data-based regression problems. We show that spectral matching can be used to learn effective potentials which retain the slow dynamics but also to correct the dynamics induced by existing techniques, such as force matching.","[Nuske, Feliks; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Nuske, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",feliks.nueske@rice.edu; cecilia@rice.edu,,"Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358; Nuske, Feliks/0000-0003-2444-7889","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, CHE-1900374, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Einstein Foundation Berlin (Einstein Visiting Fellowship); Rice University Academy of Fellows; Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]","We thank Alex Kluber and Frank Noe for stimulating discussions.

Setrons, a class of competitive antagonists, cause functional inhibition of 5-HT3AR in the gastrointestinal tract and brainstem, acting as effective anti-emetic agents. Despite their prevalent use, the molecular mechanisms underlying setron binding and inhibition of 5-HT3AR are not fully understood. Here, we present the structure of granisetron-bound full-length 5-HT3AR solved by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to 2.92 angstrom resolution.

During the self-assembly, two processes take place: Langmuir preferential adsorption and rearrangement on the surface. The rearrangement starts with nucleation, in which molecules create an ordered domain. The nucleation mechanism is temperature dependent. At lower temperature independent, small and stable nuclei seed the emergence of long-range ordered domains. In contrast, at a higher temperature, molecules adsorb on the surface, and only when a certain level of surface coverage by the adsorbent is reached, the whole structure undergoes a transition from a liquid-like structure to an ordered structure. After this step, relatively slow corrections of the structure take place by Ostwald ripening.","[Piskorz, Tomasz K.; Gobbo, Cristian; van Esch, Jan H.] Delft Univ Technol, Adv Soft Matter, Chem Engn, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands; [De Feyter, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Chem, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Marrink, Siewert J.; de Vries, Alex H.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Biomol Sci & Biotechnol Inst, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Marrink, Siewert J.; de Vries, Alex H.] Univ Groningen, Zernike Inst Adv Mat, Nijenborgh 4, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands","van Esch, JH (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Adv Soft Matter, Chem Engn, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands.",j.h.vanesch@tudelft.nl,"van Esch, Jan H/E-5543-2011; Marrink, Siewert J/G-3706-2014; De Feyter, Steven/K-7245-2014","van Esch, Jan H/0000-0001-6116-4808; Marrink, Siewert J/0000-0001-8423-5277; De Feyter, Steven/0000-0002-0909-9292",EC seventh Framework Programme Marie Curie Actions via the European Initial Training Network SMARTNETEuropean Union (EU) [316656],The authors acknowledge the financial support by the EC seventh Framework Programme Marie Curie Actions via the European Initial Training Network SMARTNET No. 316656.,,69,0,0,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1932-7447,,,J PHYS CHEM C,J.

How phosphorylation modulates structural ensemble of disordered peptide remains largely unexplored. Here, using replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and Markov state model (MSM), the conformational distribution and kinetics of p53 N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) 2 as well as its dual-site phosphorylated form (pSer46, pThr55) were simulated. It reveals that the dual phosphorylation does not change overall size and secondary structure element fraction, while a change in the distribution of hydrogen bonds induces slightly more pre-existing bound helical conformations. MSM analysis indicates that the dual phosphorylation accelerates conformation exchange between disordered and order-like states in target-binding region. It suggests that p53 TAD2 after phosphorylation would be more apt to bind to both the human p62 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the yeast tfb1 PH domain through different binding mechanism, where experimentally it exhibits an extended and alpha-helix conformation, respectively, with increased binding strength in both complexes. Our study implies except binding interface, both conformation ensemble and kinetics should be considered for the effects of phosphorylation on IDPs.","[Zhao, Likun; Ouyang, Yanhua; Li, Qian; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,"; Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhao, Likun/0000-0003-3817-2329; Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21633001, 31870718]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China [Nos. 21633001, 31870718].",,69,1,1,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0739-1102,1538-0254,,J BIOMOL STRUCT DYN,J.

The newly developed method BLUES combines molecular dynamics with nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo. Nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo generates a plethora of possible binding modes and molecular dynamics enables the system to relax. We used BLUES to investigate binding modes of caffeine in the active site of its metabolizing enzyme Cytochrome P450 1A2 with the aim of elucidating metabolite-formation profiles at different concentrations. Because the activation energies of all sites of metabolism do not show a clear preference for one metabolite over the others, the orientations in the active site must play a key role. In simulations with caffeine located in a spacious pocket above the I-helix, it points N3 and N1 to the heme iron, whereas in simulations where caffeine is in close proximity to the heme N7 and C8 are preferably oriented toward the heme iron. We propose a mechanism where at low caffeine concentrations caffeine binds to the upper part of the active site, leading to formation of the main metabolite paraxanthine. On the other hand, at high concentrations two molecules are located in the active site, forcing one molecule into close proximity to the heme and yielding metabolites theophylline and trimethyluretic acid.

Here, we present a general framework for calculating these dynamical quantities by approximating boundary value problems using dynamical operators with a Galerkin expansion. A specific choice of basis set in the expansion corresponds to the estimation of dynamical quantities using a Markov state model. More generally, the boundary conditions impose restrictions on the choice of basis sets. We demonstrate how an alternative basis can be constructed using ideas from diffusion maps. In our numerical experiments, this basis gives results of comparable or better accuracy to Markov state models. Additionally, we show that delay embedding can reduce the information lost when projecting the system's dynamics for model construction; this improves estimates of dynamical statistics considerably over the standard practice of increasing the lag time.

Here, we introduce a molecular dynamics-based approach to capture a diverse conformational ensemble of the CDR-H3 loop in solution. The results clearly indicate that the inherently flexible CDR-H3 loop indeed needs to be characterized as a conformational ensemble. The conformational changes of the CDR-H3 loop in all antibodies investigated follow the paradigm of conformation selection, because we observe the experimentally determined binding competent conformation without the presence of the antigen within the ensemble of pre-existing conformational states in solution before binding. We also demonstrate for several examples that the conformation observed in the antibody crystal structure without antigen present is actually selected to bind the carboxyterminal tail region of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab). Thus, special care must be taken when characterizing antibody CDR-H3 loops by Fab X-ray structures, and the possibility that pre-existing conformations are present should always be considered.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Kraml, Johannes; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Kraml, Johannes; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Georges, Guy] Roche Innovat Ctr Munich, Large Mol Res, Roche Pharma Res & Early Dev, Penzberg, Germany","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, CMBI, Innrain 80-82, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,"Liedl, Klaus/F-3099-2015","Liedl, Klaus/0000-0002-0985-2299",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565],This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grant [P30565] Characterization of Promiscuity and Specificity in Proteases.,,70,9,9,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1942-0862,1942-0870,,MABS-AUSTIN,mAbs,AUG 18,2019,11,6,,,,,1077,1088,,10.1080/19420862.2019.1618676,,JUN 2019,12,"Medicine, Research & Experimental",Research & Experimental Medicine,IO0AW,WOS:000475284800001,31148507,"Other Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.","[Chen, Wei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Sidky, Hythem; Ferguson, Andrew L.] Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Engn, 5640 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Ferguson, AL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Mol Engn, 5640 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",andrewferguson@uchicago.edu,,"Ferguson, Andrew/0000-0002-8829-9726",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1841805]; Molecular Software Sciences Institute (MolSSI) Software Fellows program (NSF) [ACI-1547580],"This material is based on the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CHE-1841805.

Molecular dynamics for 1.5 mu s and Markov state model analysis showed that the new catalytic triad should be operative in the mutant enzyme, suggesting functionality. QM/MM modeling performed for the reaction of wild-type BChE and double mutant with echothiophate showed high reactivity of the mutant towards the organophosphate. A truncated monomeric (L530 stop) double mutant was expressed in Expi293 cells. Non-purified transfected cell culture medium was analyzed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under native conditions followed by activity staining with BTC as the substrate provided evidence that the monomeric BChE mutant was active. Inhibition of the double mutant by echothiophate followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and activity staining showed that this enzyme slowly self-reactivated. However, because Expi293 cells secrete an endogenous BChE tetramer and several organophosphate-reacting enzymes, catalytic parameters and self-reactivation constants after phosphorylation of the new mutant were not determined in the crude cell culture medium.

The variational principle has opened the door for a nearly fully automated toolkit for selecting models that predict the long time-scale kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations. However, one yet-unoptimized step of the pipeline involves choosing the features, or collective variables, from which the model should be constructed. In order to build intuitive models, these collective variables are often sought to be interpretable and familiar features, such as torsional angles or contact distances in a protein structure. However, previous approaches for evaluating the chosen features rely on constructing a full MSM, which in turn requires additional hyperparameters to be chosen, and hence leads to a computationally expensive framework. Here, we present a method to optimize the feature choice directly, without requiring the construction of the final kinetic model. We demonstrate our rigorous preprocessing algorithm on a canonical set of 12 fast-folding protein simulations and show that our procedure leads to more efficient model selection.

With the rapid development of experimental and computational methods, it is of great interest to integrate these approaches to illuminate the conformational landscapes of target proteins. SETD8 is a protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT), which functions in vivo via the methylation of histone and nonhistone targets. Utilizing covalent inhibitors and depleting native ligands to trap hidden conformational states, we obtained diverse X-ray structures of SETD8. These structures were used to seed distributed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that generated a total of six milliseconds of trajectory data. Markov state models, built via an automated machine learning approach and corroborated experimentally, reveal how slow conformational motions and conformational states are relevant to catalysis. These findings provide molecular insight on enzymatic catalysis and allosteric mechanisms of a PKMT via its detailed conformational landscape.","[Chen, Shi; Wiewiora, Rafal P.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Triinst PhD Program Chem Biol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Chen, Shi; Wang, Junyi; Blum, Gil; Pittella-Silva, Fabio; Luo, Minkui] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Chem Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Wiewiora, Rafal P.; Beauchamp, Kyle A.; Chodera, John D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat & Syst Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Meng, Fanwang; Fan, Shijie; Jiang, Hualiang; Chen, Kaixian; Luo, Cheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Mt Sinai Ctr Therapeut Discovery, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Oncol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Babault, Nicolas; Ma, Anqi; Jin, Jian] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Tisch Canc Inst, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Yu, Wenyu; Tempel, Wolfram; Brown, Peter J.] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Qian, Kun; Hu, Hao; Zheng, Yujun George] Univ Georgia, Dept Pharmaceut & Biomed Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Zou, Hua; Skene, Robert J.] Takeda Calif, Sci Ctr Dr, San Diego, CA USA; [Fan, Shijie; Jiang, Hualiang; Chen, Kaixian; Luo, Cheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Minkui] Cornell Univ, Program Pharmacol, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA","Luo, MK (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Chem Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Chodera, JD (corresponding author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat & Syst Biol Program, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA.; Luo, C (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Luo, C (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Luo, MK (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Program Pharmacol, Weill Cornell Med Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.",cluo@simm.ac.cn; john.chodera@choderalab.org; luom@mskcc.org,"Chen, Shi/AAE-9474-2020; Meng, Fanwang/K-4079-2019; Hu, Hao/AAJ-8523-2020","Chen, Shi/0000-0002-5860-2616; Meng, Fanwang/0000-0003-2886-7012; Hu, Hao/0000-0003-1365-0267; Qian, Kun/0000-0003-1132-2374; Brown, Peter/0000-0002-8454-0367; Chodera, John/0000-0003-0542-119X","UNC Eshelman Institute for Innovation; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [19XD1404700, 18431907100]; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation; Novartis Pharma; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R35GM131858, R01GM120570, R01GM126154, R01GM121505, R01GM122749, R01GM096056]; MerckMerck & Company; Janssen PharmaceuticalsJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81625022, 21820202008, 81430084, 91853205]; National Science & Technology Major Project of China [2018ZX09711002]; Mr. William H.

The state-of-the-art Markov state modeling methods and tools are very well developed for the modeling of reversible processes in closed equilibrium systems. On the contrary, they are largely not well suited to deal with nonreversible or even nonautonomous processes of nonequiibrium systems. Thus, we generalized the common Robust Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis (PCCA+) method to enable straightforward modeling of nonequiibrium systems as well. The resulting Generalized PCCA (G-PCCA) method readily handles equilibrium as well as nonequiibrium data by utilizing real Schur vectors instead of eigenvectors. This is implemented in the G-PCCA algorithm that enables the semiautomatic coarse graining of molecular kinetics. G-PCCA is not limited to the detection of metastable states but also enables the identification and modeling of cyclic processes. This is demonstrated by three typical examples of nonreversible systems.

The hAsp enzyme hydrolyzes one of the most abundant amino acid derivatives in the brain, N-acetyl-aspartate. It is important to understand the reasons for diminishing activity of the mutated enzymes, which is crucial for Canavan disease patients bearing the mutated gene. We explore a model which suggests operation of hAsp in the dimer form with two dynamically inequivalent subunits. Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the replacements Y231C and F295S at the periphery of the protein shift the equilibrium between hAsp conformations with the open and closed gates to the enzyme active site buried inside the protein. Application of the dynamical network analysis and the Markov state model approach allows us to strengthen this conclusion and provide a detailed description of dynamically induced structural changes of the protein. The decreased availability of the active site for substrate molecules in the mutated enzymes explains their diminishing activity observed in clinical experiments.","[Kots, Ekaterina D.; Khrenova, Maria G.; Nemukhin, Alexander V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Chem, Leninskie Gory 1-3, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Kots, Ekaterina D.; Nemukhin, Alexander V.] Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, Kosygina 4, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Khrenova, Maria G.] Russian Acad Sci, Bach Inst Biochem, Fed Res Ctr Biotechnol, Leninskiy Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia","Khrenova, MG (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Chem, Leninskie Gory 1-3, Moscow 119991, Russia.; Khrenova, MG (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Bach Inst Biochem, Fed Res Ctr Biotechnol, Leninskiy Prospect 33, Moscow 119071, Russia.",khrenova.maria@gmail.com,"Khrenova, Maria G/I-4829-2014","Khrenova, Maria G/0000-0001-7117-3089; Nemukhin, Alexander/0000-0002-4992-6029",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-13-00124],This study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project #14-13-00124).

Often, these proteins are embedded within a membrane, which creates particular experimental challenges to surmount. This has resulted in computational methods providing a valuable complementary tool for some time now, especially in the development of working models at atomic resolution. Indeed, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are now routinely applied to new structures, either as part of the initial analysis or as part of an automated pipeline. Such simulations have proven extremely useful in terms of characterizing the inherent underlying conformational dynamics or providing insight into the interactions with the surrounding lipid molecules. However, MD simulations are capable of providing much more sophisticated information, including fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic properties of transitions between states and a description of how those transitions are influenced by the presence of ligands. There is a very large array of advanced simulation methods that can provide this information, but in this short review we limit ourselves to some selected examples of techniques that have given particular insight into proteins associated with molecular neurobiology. In this review, we highlight the use of i) Markov State Modelling to examine sodium dynamics in the dopamine transporter, ii) Metadynamics to explore neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated ion channel and iii) Steered MD to investigate conformational change in ionotropic glutamate receptors.","[Damgen, Marc A.; Biggin, Philip C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford, England","Biggin, PC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Biochem, Oxford, England.",Philip.biggin@bioch.ox.ac.uk,,"Damgen, Marc/0000-0002-8229-7906; Biggin, Philip/0000-0001-5100-8836",Oxford Wolfson Marriott Biochemistry Graduate Scholarship; Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/M000435/1]; BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M006395/1],MAD was supported by an Oxford Wolfson Marriott Biochemistry Graduate Scholarship and by the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes.

Detailed, physics-based simulation methods are demonstrating rapidly growing impact in areas as diverse as biocatalysis, drug delivery, biomaterials, biotechnology, and drug design. Simulations offer the potential of uniquely detailed, atomic-level insight into mechanisms, dynamics, and processes, as well as increasingly accurate predictions of molecular properties. Simulations can now be used as computational assays of biological activity, for example, in predictions of drug resistance. Methodological and algorithmic developments, combined with advances in computational hardware, are transforming the scope and range of calculations. Different types of methods are required for different types of problem. Accurate methods and extensive simulations promise quantitative comparison with experiments across biochemistry. Atomistic simulations can now access experimentally relevant timescales for large systems, leading to a fertile interplay of experiment and theory and offering unprecedented opportunities for validating and developing models. Coarse-grained methods allow studies on larger length- and timescales, and theoretical developments are bringing electronic structure calculations into new regimes. Multiscale methods are another key focus for development, combining different levels of theory to increase accuracy, aiming to connect chemical and molecular changes to macroscopic observables.

Since the extracellular domain (ECD) of GLP-1R is considered as one of the binding sites of GLP-1, the open and closed states of ECD play an important role in the binding process of GLP-1. To investigate the transition path of GLP-1R ECD, the crystal structures of GLP-1R in its bound and unbound states (apo-state) are chosen to perform a total of 1.6 s of molecular dynamics simulations. The simulated results show that the ECD of GLP-1R closes in the GLP-1 bound state and opens in the GLP-1 unbound state. To determine the critical role that GLP-1 played in regulating the open and closed states of the ECD, we applied the independent gradient model (IGM) to the simulation trajectories. We found that the hand-like N-terminal of the GLP-1R ECD plays an important role in the GLP-1 binding. In contrast, the apo-state GLP-1R ECD opens and exposes the two ligand binding domains of GLP-1 after 200 ns of simulations. To elucidate the open and closed mechanisms of GLP-1R ECD in the apo-state and GLP-1 bound state, the Markov state model (MSM) is performed on the MD simulation trajectories. Our results provide possible transition pathways from the closed state to open state of the apo-state GLP-1R ECD. Each pathway contains several intermediate states that correspond to different local minima in deep wells. The dynamical relationships and the most possible conversion pathway between two states are detailed through the MSM analysis. Our results profile the conformation transition mechanism of the GLP-1R ECD and will help in hypoglycemic peptide design of GLP-1R.","[Zhang, Jintu; Bai, Qifeng; An, Xiaoli] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol, Key Lab Preclin Study New Drugs Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jintu; Shang, Shuxia; Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Perez-Sanchez, Horacio] Univ Catolica San Antonio de Murcia UCAM, Dept Comp Sci, Murcia, Spain","Bai, QF (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Inst Biochem & Mol Biol, Key Lab Preclin Study New Drugs Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.; Yao, XJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",baiqf@lzu.edu.cn; xjyao@lzu.edu.cn,"Bai, Qifeng/A-2950-2019","Bai, Qifeng/0000-0001-7296-6187","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21605066]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2018-92, lzujbky-2017-122]; CERNET Innovation Project [NGII20180704]","The work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21605066), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. lzujbky-2018-92 and Grant No. lzujbky-2017-122) and CERNET Innovation Project (NGII20180704).",,42,4,4,3,11,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

However, existing dynamical dimension reduction methods, such as the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), are only valid if the dynamics obeys detailed balance (microscopic reversibility) and typically require long, equilibrated simulation trajectories. Here, we develop a dimension reduction method for non-equilibrium dynamics based on the recently developed Variational Approach for Markov Processes (VAMP) by Wu and Noe. VAMP is illustrated by obtaining a low-dimensional description of a single file ion diffusion model and by identifying long-lived states from molecular dynamics simulations of the KcsA channel protein in an external electrochemical potential. This analysis provides detailed insights into the coupling of conformational dynamics, the configuration of the selectivity filter, and the conductance of the channel. We recommend VAMP as a replacement for the less general TICA method.

These class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in mammalian signaling pathways and control cell migration toward endogenous CC chemokine ligands, named for the adjacent cysteine motif on their N terminus. Chemokine receptors and their associated ligands are involved in a wide range of diseases and thus have become important drug targets. CCR2, in particular, promotes the metastasis of cancer cells and is also implicated in autoimmunity-driven type-1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, multiple sclerosis, asthma, atherosclerosis, neuropathic pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although promising, CCR2 antagonists have been largely unsuccessful to date. Here, we investigate the effect of an orthosteric and an allosteric antagonist on CCR2 dynamics by coupling long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations with Markov-state model theory. We find that the antagonists shift CCR2 into several stable inactive conformations that are distinct from the crystal structure conformation and disrupt a continuous internal water and sodium ion pathway, preventing transitions to an active-like state. Several metastable conformations present a cryptic drug-binding pocket near the allosteric site that may be amenable to targeting with small molecules. Without antagonists, the apo dynamics reveal intermediate conformations along the activation pathway that provide insight into the basal dynamics of CCR2 and may also be useful for future drug design.","[Taylor, Bryn C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Biomed Sci Grad Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Lee, Christopher T.; Amaro, Rommie E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Amaro, RE (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Chem & Biochem, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ramaro@ucsd.edu,,"Taylor, Bryn/0000-0002-4957-5417; Lee, Christopher/0000-0002-0670-2308","Director's New Innovator Award Program NIH [DP2-OD007237]; National Biomedical Computation Resource NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41-GM103426]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [TG-CHE060073]; NIH Molecular Biophysics Training ProgramUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32-GM008326]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM116961]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008326, T32GM008326, R01GM116961, P41GM103426, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, P41GM103426, T32GM008326, T32GM008326, P41GM103426, P41GM103426, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, T32GM008326] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Tracy Handel and Irina Kufareva for their valuable input and initial modification of CCR2 coordinates.

In particular, we first introduce a method for determining biomolecular dynamics employing core set Markov state models constructed using an advanced clustering technique. The method is validated on previously reported simulations. We then use the method to analyze extensive trajectories for four different RNA model duplexes: Results obtained using D. E.

Previous biophysical studies have suggested that conformational exchange between a 'major' active and a 'minor' inactive state on millisecond timescales plays a key role in catalysis for CypA. Here this hypothesis is addressed by a variety of molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Strikingly we show that exchange between major and minor active site conformations occurs at a rate that is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed. The minor active site conformation is found to be catalytically impaired, and decreased catalytic activity of the mutants is caused by changes in Phell3 motions on a ns-mu s timescale. Therefore millisecond timescale motions may not be necessary to explain allosteric effects in cyclophilins.","[Wapeesittipan, Pattama; Mey, Antonia S. J.

In this paper, we extend the applicability of automated Markov state modeling to simulation data of molecular self-assembly and aggregation by constructing collective coordinates from molecular descriptors that are invariant to permutations of molecular indexing. Understanding molecular self-assembly is of critical importance if we want to deepen our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases where the aggregation of misfolded or disordered proteins is thought to be the main culprit. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate our Markov state model technique on simulations of the KFFE peptide, a subsequence of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide and one of the smallest peptides known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils in vitro. We investigate the different stages of aggregation up to tetramerization and show that the Markov state models clearly map out the different aggregation pathways. Of note is that disordered and beta-sheet oligomers do not interconvert, leading to separate pathways for their formation. This suggests that amyloid aggregation of KFFE occurs via ordered aggregates from the very beginning. The code developed here is freely available as a Jupyter notebook called TICAgg, which can be used for the automated analysis of any self-assembling molecular system, protein, or otherwise.

In this work, we applied the same procedure to a complex of MDM2 protein and the transactivation domain of p53 protein (TAD-p53), the latter of which is known to be very flexible in the unbound state. Using 30 independent MD simulations in PaCS-MD, we successfully generated 25 dissociation pathways of the complex, which showed complete or partial unfolding of the helical region of TAD-p53 during the dissociation process within an average simulation time of 154.8 +/- 46.4 ns. The standard binding free energy obtained in combination with one-dimensional-, three-dimensional (3D)- or C-alpha-MSM was in good agreement with those determined experimentally. Using 3D-MSM based on the center of mass position of TAD-p53 relative to MDM2, the dissociation rate constant was calculated, which was comparable to those measured experimentally. C-alpha-MSM based on all C-alpha coordinates of TAD-p53 reproduced the experimentally measured standard binding free energy, and dissociation and association rate constants. We conclude that the combination of PaCS-MD and MSM offers an efficient computational procedure to calculate binding free energies and kinetic rates.","[Duy Phuoc Tran; Kitao, Akio] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan","Kitao, A (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528550, Japan.",akitao@bio.titech.ac.jp,"Kitao, Akio/B-8371-2008; Duy, TRAN Phuoc/N-9948-2019","Kitao, Akio/0000-0002-5221-0806; Duy, TRAN Phuoc/0000-0001-8212-3706","MEXT/JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP25104002, JP15H04357]; MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science through the HPCI System Research project [hp150270, hp160207, hp170254, hp180201]; Hitachi Scholarship Program of the Hitachi Global Foundation [S175]","This research was supported by MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI (Nos.

Through clustering analysis of a large kinome profiling dataset, we found a cluster of eight promiscuous kinases that on average bind more than five times more kinase inhibitors than the other 398 kinases in the dataset. To understand the structural basis of promiscuous inhibitor binding, we determined the co-crystal structure of the receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 with the type I inhibitors dasatinib and VX-680. Surprisingly, we find that DDR1 binds these type I inhibitors in an inactive conformation typically reserved for type II inhibitors. Our computational and biochemical studies show that DDR1 is unusually stable in this inactive conformation, giving a mechanistic explanation for inhibitor promiscuity. This phenotypic clustering analysis provides a strategy to obtain functional insights not available by sequence comparison alone.","[Hanson, Sonya M.; Georghiou, George; Thakur, Manish K.; Seeliger, Markus A.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Pharmacol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Hanson, Sonya M.; Chodera, John D.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Computat & Syst Biol Program, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Miller, W.

Analysis of multiple microsecond-length trajectories shows that the DNMPs sample all four coplanar stacking motifs. In addition, three metastable unstacked conformations are detected. A hidden Markov-state model (HMSM) was applied to the simulations to estimate transition rates between the stacked and unstacked states. Transitions between different stacked states generally occur at higher rates when the number of nucleobase faces requiring desolvation is minimized. Time constants for structural relaxation range between 1.6 and 25 ns, suggesting that emission from photoexcited 2Ap, which has an excited-state lifetime of 10 ns, is sensitive to base stacking kinetics. A master equation model for the excited-state population of 2Ap predicts multiexponential emission decays that reproduce the sub-10 ns emission decay lifetimes and amplitudes seen in experiments. Combining MD simulations with HMSM analysis is a powerful way to understand the dynamics that influence 2Ap excited-state relaxation and represents an important step toward using observed emission signals to validate MD simulations.","[Remington, Jacob M.] Montana State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [McCullagh, Martin] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kohler, Bern] Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, 100 West 18th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","McCullagh, M (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.; Kohler, B (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, 100 West 18th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",Martin.McCullagh@colostate.edu; kohler.40@osu.edu,"; Kohler, Bern/A-1728-2011","McCullagh, Martin/0000-0002-8603-4388; Kohler, Bern/0000-0001-5353-1655",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1817500],We thank Russell Davidson for the parameterization of the 2Ap residue.

Following the dimensionality reduction in a molecular dynamics trajectory, these microstates can be generated by a recently proposed density-based geometrical clustering algorithm [F. Sittel and G. Stock, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12, 242 6 (2016)], which by design cuts the resulting clusters at the energy barriers and allows for a data-based identification of all parameters. Nevertheless, projection artifacts due to the inevitable restriction to a low-dimensional space combined with insufficient sampling often leads to a misclassification of sampled points in the transition regions. This typically causes intrastate fluctuations to be mistaken as interstate transitions, which leads to artificially short life times of the metastable states. As a simple but effective remedy, dynamical coring requires that the trajectory spends a minimum time in the new state for the transition to be counted. Adopting molecular dynamics simulations of two well-established biomolecular systems (alanine dipeptide and villin headpiece), dynamical coring is shown to considerably improve the Markovianity of the resulting metastable states, which is demonstrated by Chapman-Kolmogorov tests and increased implied time scales of the Markov model. Providing high structural and temporal resolution, the combination of density-based clustering and dynamical coring is particularly suited to describe the complex structural dynamics of unfolded biomolecules.

Tuning the populations of the enzyme conformational states through mutation enables evolution towards novel activity. Herein, Markov state models are used to unveil hidden conformational states of monoamine oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N). These hidden conformations, not previously observed by any other technique, play a crucial role in substrate binding and enzyme activity. This reveals how distal mutations regulate MAO-N activity by stabilizing these hidden, catalytically important conformational states, but also by modulating the communication pathway between both MAO-N subunits.","[Curado-Carballada, Christian; Feixas, Ferran; Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier; Osuna, Silvia] IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain; [Curado-Carballada, Christian; Feixas, Ferran; Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier; Osuna, Silvia] Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain; [Osuna, Silvia] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Osuna, S (corresponding author), IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain.; Osuna, S (corresponding author), Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Catalonia, Spain.; Osuna, S (corresponding author), ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain.",silvia.osuna@udg.edu,"Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier/AAF-1019-2019; Feixas, Ferran/B-6192-2009; Feixas, Ferran/K-5597-2014","Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier/0000-0001-7773-2945; Feixas, Ferran/0000-0001-5147-0000; Osuna, Silvia/0000-0003-3657-6469","European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [MSCA-IF-2014-EF-661160, H2020-MSCA-IF-2016-753045, PCIG14-GA-2013-630978]; Spanish MINECO [CTQ2014-59212-P]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programmeEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2015-StG-679001]; Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2014-16846]","F.F. and J.I.F. thank the European Community for Marie Curie fellowships MSCA-IF-2014-EF-661160, and H2020-MSCA-IF-2016-753045, respectively.

As the physiologic and pathologic roles of the light chain still remain vague, here, we continue previous efforts to understand the impacts of the disease-associated single deletion of LYS9 in the light chain. By combining supervised and unsupervised machine learning methodologies and more traditional structural analyses on data from 10 mu s molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the conformational ensemble of the Delta K9 mutant is significantly perturbed. Our analyses consistently indicate that LYS9 deletion destabilizes both the catalytic cleft and regulatory functional regions and result in some conformational changes that occur in tens to hundreds of nanosecond scaled motions. We also reveal that the two forms of thrombin each prefer a distinct binding mode of a Na+ ion. We expand our understanding of previous experimental observations and shed light on the mechanisms of the LYS9 deletion associated bleeding disorder by providing consistent but more quantitative and detailed structural analyses than early studies in literature. With a novel application of supervised learning, i.e. the decision tree learning on the hydrogen bonding features in the wild-type and Delta K9 mutant forms of thrombin, we predict that seven pairs of critical hydrogen bonding interactions are significant for establishing distinct behaviors of wild-type thrombin and its Delta K9 mutant form. Our calculations indicate the LYS9 in the light chain has both localized and long-range allosteric effects on thrombin, supporting the opinion that light chain has an important role as an allosteric effector.","[Xiao, Jiajie; Melvin, Ryan L.; Salsbury, Freddie R., Jr.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Phys, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Xiao, Jiajie] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27109

The respiratory complex I functions as the primary redox-driven proton pump in mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains, and its activity is strongly enhanced by cardiolipin. However, despite recent advances in the structural biology of complex I, cardiolipin-specific interaction mechanisms currently remain unknown. On the basis of millisecond molecular simulations, we suggest that cardiolipin binds to proton-pumping subunits of complex I and induces global conformational changes that modulate the accessibility of the quinone substrate to the enzyme. Our findings provide key information on the coupling between complex I dynamics and activity and suggest how biological membranes modulate the structure and activity of proteins.","[Jussupow, Alexander; Di Luca, Andrea; Kaila, Ville R., I] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany","Kaila, VRI (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Dept Chem, Lichtenbergstr 4, D-85747 Garching, Germany.",ville.kaila@ch.tum.de,,"Kaila, Ville/0000-0003-4464-6324; Di Luca, Andrea/0000-0001-6138-2485; Jussupow, Alexander/0000-0001-7851-2741",European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [715311]; German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG),This work received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program/grant agreement 715311.

However, the mechanism of thrombin's activation by Na+ has been widely debated for more than twenty years. Details of the linkage between thrombin and Na+ remain vague due to limited temporal and spatial resolution in experiments. In this work, we combine microsecond scale atomic-detailed molecular dynamics simulations with correlation network analyses and hidden Markov modeling to probe the detailed thermodynamic and kinetic picture of Na+-binding events and their resulting allosteric responses in thrombin. We reveal that ASP189 and ALA190 comprise a stable Na+-binding site (referred as inner Na+-binding site) along with the previously known one (referred as outer Na+-binding site). The corresponding newly identified Na+-binding mode introduces significant allosteric responses in thrombin's regulatory regions by stabilizing selected torsion angles of residues responsive to Na+-binding. Our Markov model indicates that the bound Na+ prefers to transfer between the two Na+-binding sites when an unbinding event takes place. These results suggest a testable hypothesis of a substrate-driven Na+ migration (G approximate to 1.7 kcal mol(-1)) from the inner Na+-binding site to the outer one during thrombin's catalytic activities. The binding of a Na+ ion at the inner Na+-binding site should be inferred as a prerequisite for thrombin's efficient recognition to the substrate, which opens a new angle for our understanding of Na+-binding's allosteric activation on thrombin and sheds light on detailed processes in thrombin's activation.","[Xiao, Jiajie; Salsbury, Freddie R., Jr.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Phys, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Xiao, Jiajie] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA","Salsbury, FR (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ, Dept Phys, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",salsbufr@wfu.edu,,"Xiao, Jiajie/0000-0002-5126-4423; Salsbury, Freddie/0000-0002-2699-829X","Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center Crystallography & Computational Biosciences Shared Resource - National Cancer Institute's Cancer Center Support Grant [P30CA012197]; Wake Forest University Center of Molecular Signaling fellowship; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197, P30CA012197] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors thank Dr Ryan Melvin's feedback on Fig. 2.

Lignin chemical diversity complicates traditional structural studies, and so, relatively little experimental evidence exists for how lignin structure exists in aqueous solution or how lignin polymers respond to changes in their chemical environment. Molecular modeling can address these concerns; however, prior computational structural lignin models typically did not capture lignin heterogeneity, as only a few polymers were considered. LigninBuilder creates a framework for building structural libraries for lignin from existing topological libraries, permitting significantly greater diversity of lignin structures to be sampled at atomic detail. As a demonstration of its capabilities, LigninBuilder was applied to three libraries of lignin from hardwood, softwood, and grass, and the resulting polymer structures were simulated in an aqueous environment. The lignins adopted compact globular structures, as would be expected for polymers in poor solvents. The differences between the libraries were largest when quantifying the packing of nonadjacent aromatic residues, with greater branching within the polymer resulting in poorer aromatic packing. Individual lignin polymers were also found to undergo rapid conformational changes, with the dwell time within a state growing as the square of the molecular weight. This first application of LigninBuilder demonstrates the potential for atomic-level insight into lignin interactions. LigninBuilder is distributed as a plugin to the visualization software VMD, lowering the barrier for modeling lignin structure in diverse environments.","[Vermaas, Josh V.; Crowley, Michael F.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Dellon, Lauren D.; Broadbelt, Linda J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Beckham, Gregg T.] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Natl Bioenergy Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA","Crowley, MF (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Biosci Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.; Beckham, GT (corresponding author), Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Natl Bioenergy Ctr, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",gregg.beckham@nrel.gov; michael.crowley@nrel.gov,"Broadbelt, Linda/B-7640-2009; Vermaas, Josh/X-7032-2019","Vermaas, Josh/0000-0003-3139-6469","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC36-08G028308]; NREL Director's Fellowship - Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1435228]; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Bioenergy Technology OfficeUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Center for Bioenergy Innovation, U.S. DOE Bioenergy Research Center - Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and located at the National Renewable Energy LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","The authors thank Noah Trebesch for a fruitful discussion that guided the design of the algorithm for automated ring piercing amelioration, as well as Loukas Petridis and Nicholas Rorrer for discussions relating to polymer theory.

While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called OpenPathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant (RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.","[Swenson, David W.

Despite having very long MD trajectories, some states and pathways can be missing in the MD data, which may make the MSMs incomplete. Consequently, uncertainty quantification for the resulting MSM becomes important. Using deca-alanine as a prototype system, we demonstrate that rare-event acceleration techniques can be employed to greatly lower the MSM uncertainty with a high computational efficiency with the assumption that the rare-event acceleration technique is able to determine most pathways that are relevant to the dynamics. In particular, we explore applications of steered MD to construct MSMs. Upper and lower bounds for uncertainty in the resulting MSM are derived. Safeguards are built into our approach to handle scenarios where the rare-event acceleration technique is unable to discover some important pathways.

Given the enormity of conformational space, there has been ongoing interest in identifying a small number of states that capture the essential features of a protein. Generally, this is achieved by making assumptions about the properties of relevant features-for example, that the most important features are those that change slowly. An alternative strategy is to keep as many degrees of freedom as possible and subsequently learn from the model which of the features are most important. In these larger models, however, traditional approaches quickly become computationally intractable. In this paper, we present enspara, a library for working with MSMs that provides several novel algorithms and specialized data structures that dramatically improve the scalability of traditional MSM methods. This includes ragged arrays for minimizing memory requirements, message passing interface-parallelized implementations of compute-intensive operations, and a flexible framework for model construction and analysis.

This polymorphism occurs in short consensus repeat (SCR) 7 of FH and results in decreased binding affinity of SCR6-8 for heparin. As FH is responsible for regulating the complement system, decreased affinity for heparin results in decreased regulation on surfaces of self. To understand the involvement of the Y402H polymorphism in AMD, we leverage methods from bioinformatics and computational biophysics to quantify structural and dynamical differences between SCR7 isoforms that contribute to decreased pattern recognition in SCR7(H402). Our data from molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations suggest a revised mechanism for decreased heparin binding. In this model, transient contacts not observed in structures for SCR7 are predicted to occur in molecular dynamics simulations between coevolved residues Y402 and 1412, stabilizing SCR7(Y402) in a conformation that promotes association with heparin. H402 in the risk isoform is less likely to form a contact with 1412 and samples a larger conformational space than Y402. We observe energy minima for sidechains of Y402 and R404 from SCR7(Y402) that are predicted to associate with heparin at a rate constant faster than energy minima for sidechains of H402 and R404 from SCR7(H402). As both carbohydrate density and degree of sulfation decrease with age in Bruch's membrane of the macula, the decreased heparin recognition of SCR7(H402) may contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.","[Harrison, Reed E.

These models require configuration-space representations that accurately characterize the relevant dynamics. Well-established, low-dimensional order parameters for constructing this representation have led to widespread application of Markov state models to study conformational dynamics in biomolecular systems. On the contrary, applications to characterize single-molecule diffusion processes have been scarce and typically employ system-specific, higher-dimensional order parameters to characterize the local solvation state of the molecule. In this work, we propose an automated method for generating a coarse configuration-space representation, using generic features of the solvation structure-the coordination numbers about each particle. To overcome the inherent noisy behavior of these low-dimensional observables, we treat the features as indicators of an underlying, latent Markov process. The resulting hidden Markov models filter the trajectories of each feature into the most likely latent solvation state at each time step. The filtered trajectories are then used to construct a configuration-space discretization, which accurately describes the diffusion kinetics. The method is validated on a standard model for glassy liquids, where particle jumps between local cages determine the diffusion properties of the system. Not only do the resulting models provide quantitatively accurate characterizations of the diffusion constant, but they also reveal a mechanistic description of diffusive jumps, quantifying the heterogeneity of local diffusion.

We selected six antibodies in three pairs differing substantially in their individual promiscuity respectively specificity. For two pairs of antibodies crystal structures are available in different states of maturation and used as starting structures for the analyses. For a third pair we chose two antibody CDR sequences obtained from a synthetic library and predicted the respective structures. For all three pairs of antibodies we performed metadynamics simulations to overcome the limitations in conformational sampling imposed by high energy barriers. Additionally, we used classic molecular dynamics simulations to describe nano- to microsecond flexibility and to estimate up to millisecond kinetics of captured conformational transitions. The methodology represents the antibodies as conformational ensembles and allows comprehensive analysis of structural diversity, thermodynamics of conformations and kinetics of structural transitions. Referring to the concept of conformational selection we investigated the link between promiscuity and flexibility of the antibodies' binding interfaces. The obtained detailed characterization of the binding interface clearly indicates a link between structural flexibility and binding promiscuity for this set of antibodies.","[Fernandez-Quintero, Monica L.; Loeffler, Johannes R.; Kraml, Johannes; Kahler, Ursula; Kamenik, Anna S.; Liedl, Klaus R.] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, CMBI, Innsbruck, Austria","Liedl, KR (corresponding author), Univ Innsbruck, Inst Gen Inorgan & Theoret Chem, CMBI, Innsbruck, Austria.",Klaus.Liedl@uibk.ac.at,"Liedl, Klaus/F-3099-2015","Liedl, Klaus/0000-0002-0985-2299; Kamenik, Anna Sophia/0000-0001-8657-0036","Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P30565, P30737]",This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) via the grant P30565 and grant P30737.,,81,18,18,0,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

A few studies carried out by researchers suggest that E219K prion mutant (glutamate to lysine mutation at residue position 219) is more stable than wild type protein. However a similar point mutation E200K (glutamate to lysine mutation at residue position 200) is pathogenic. In this study we have carried out detailed atomistic simulation of the wild type, pathogenic mutant E200K and E219K mutant which provides more stability. The aim of the study was to detect the early structural changes present in all the three variants which might be responsible for the stability or for their conversion from PrPC to PrPSc. MSM based analyses have been carried out to find out the differences between WT, E200K and E219K systems. Markov state model (MSM) analysis was able to predict the intermediate states which helped to understand the effect of same mutation at two different locations. The MSM analysis was able to show that the extra stability of E219K mutant may be a result of the increase in number of native contacts, strong salt bridges and less random motions. While pathogenicity of E200K mutant can be attributed to loss of some crucial salt-bridge interactions, increased random motions between helix 2 and helix 3.","[Jani, Vinod; Sonavane, Uddhavesh; Joshi, Rajendra] Ctr Dev Adv Comp, High Performance Comp Med & Bioinformat Applicat, Savitribai Phule Pune Univ Campus, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Joshi, R (corresponding author), Ctr Dev Adv Comp, High Performance Comp Med & Bioinformat Applicat, Savitribai Phule Pune Univ Campus, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.",rajendra@cdac.in,,,"Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, New Delhi; National Supercomputing Mission (NSM)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, New Delhi, and National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) for providing financial support.

We can analyze such a process in terms of metastability or coherence. Metastable sets M are defined in space M subset of Omega, and coherent sets M(t) subset of Omega are defined in space and time. Hence, if we extend the space Omega by the time-variable t, coherent sets are metastable sets in Omega x [0, infinity) of an appropriate space-time process. This relation can be exploited, because there already exist spectral algorithms for the identification of metastable sets. In this article, we show that these well-established spectral algorithms (like PCCA+, Perron Cluster Cluster Analysis) also identify coherent sets of non-autonomous dynamical systems. For the identification of coherent sets, one has to compute a discretization (a matrix T) of the transfer operator of the process using a space-time-discretization scheme. The article gives an overview about different time-discretization schemes and shows their applicability in two different fields of application.

The energetically preferred pcmnm(5)U((34)) adopted a 'skew' conformation for C5-substituted side chain (-CH2-NH2+-CH2-COO-) moiety that orient towards the 5'-ribose-phosphate backbone, which support 'anti' orientation of glycosyl (chi(34)) torsion angle. Preferred conformation of pcmnm(5)U((34)) was stabilized by O(4)center dot center dot center dot HC(10), O1P center dot center dot center dot HN(11), O(15)center dot center dot center dot HN(11), O(15)center dot center dot center dot HC(10), O4'center dot center dot center dot HC(6) and O(2)center dot center dot center dot HC2' hydrogen bonding interactions. The high flexibility of side chain moiety displayed different structural properties for pcmnm(5)U((34)). Three different conformations of pcmnm(5)U((34)) were observed in molecular dynamics simulations and Markov state model studies. The unmodified uracil revealed 'syn' and 'anti' orientations for glycosyl (chi(34)) torsion angle that substantiate the role of -CH2-NH2+-CH2-COO- moiety in maintaining the 'anti' orientation of pcmnm(5)U((34)). The preferred conformation of pcmnm(5)U((34)) helps to recognize Guanosine more proficiently than Adenosine from the third position of codons.

Several adaptive sampling strategies have been proposed, but it is not clear which methods perform better for different physical systems. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of selected adaptive sampling strategies on a wide selection of fast folding proteins. The adaptive sampling strategies were emulated using models constructed on already existing MD trajectories. We provide theoretical limits for the sampling speed-up and compare the performance of different strategies with and without using some a priori knowledge of the system. The results show that for different goals, different adaptive sampling strategies are optimal. In order to sample slow dynamical processes such as protein folding without a priori knowledge of the system, a strategy based on the identification of a set of metastable regions is consistently the most efficient, while a strategy based on the identification of microstates performs better if the goal is to explore newer regions of the conformational space. Interestingly, the maximum speed-up achievable for the adaptive sampling of slow processes increases for proteins with longer folding times, encouraging the application of these methods for the characterization of slower processes, beyond the fast-folding proteins considered here.

The analysis is based on trajectories from classical molecular dynamics simulations and accounts for the full dynamics of relative angular and separation coordinates of water clusters and requires no predefined hydrogen bond criterium. We account for the complete 12-dimensional conformational subspace of three water molecules and distinguish five well-separated slow dynamic processes with relaxation times in the picosecond range, followed by a quasi-continuum spectrum of faster modes. By analysis of the Markov eigenstates, these processes are shown to correspond to different collective interchanges of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors. Using a projection onto hydrogen-bond states, we also analyze the switching of one hydrogen bond between two acceptor water molecules and derive the complete transition network. The most probable pathway corresponds to a direct switch without an intermediate, in agreement with previous studies. However, a considerable fraction of paths proceeds along alternative routes that involve different intermediate states with short-lived alternative hydrogen bonds or weakly bound states.

However, the mechanism underlying the pharmaceutically critical process of substrate access to the catalytic center of cytochrome P450 is a long-standing puzzle, further complicated by the crystallographic evidence of a closed catalytic center in both substrate-free and substrate-bound cytochrome P450. Here, we address a crucial question whether the conformational heterogeneity prevalent in cytochrome P450 translates to heterogeneous pathways for substrate access to the catalytic center of these metalloenzymes. By atomistically capturing the full process of spontaneous substrate association from bulk solvent to the occluded catalytic center of an archetypal system P450cam in multi-microsecond-long continuous unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, we here demonstrate that the substrate recognition in P450cam always occurs through a single well-defined dominant pathway. The simulated final bound pose resulting from these unguided simulations is in striking resemblance with the crystallographic bound pose. Each individual binding trajectory reveals that the substrate, initially placed at random locations in bulk solvent, spontaneously lands on a single key channel on the protein-surface of P450cam and resides there for an uncharacteristically long period, before correctly identifying the occluded target-binding cavity. Surprisingly, the passage of substrate to the closed catalytic center is not accompanied by any large-scale opening in protein. Rather, the unbiased simulated trajectories (similar to 57 mu s) and underlying Markov state model, in combination with free-energy analysis, unequivocally show that the substrate recognition process in P450cam needs a substrate-induced side-chain displacement coupled with a complex array of dynamical interconversions of multiple metastable substrate conformations. Further, the work reconciles multiple precedent experimental and theoretical observations on P450cam and establishes a comprehensive view of substrate-recognition in cytochrome P450 that only occurs via substrate-induced structural rearrangements.","[Ahalawat, Navjeet; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, Telangana, India","Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad 500107, Telangana, India.",jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,"Ahalawat, Navjeet/0000-0002-9665-8709","TIFR, India; Department of Science and Technology (DST) of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [ECR/2016/000672]","This work was supported by computing resources obtained from the shared facility of TIFR Hyderabad, India.

A possible method for efficiently sampling the conformational space of such a complex system is metadynamics (MetaD) with path collective variables (CVs). Here, we applied well-tempered MetaD with path CVs to one of the few GPCRs for which both inactive and fully active experimental structures are available, the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), and assessed the ability of this enhanced sampling method to estimate the thermodynamic properties of receptor activation in line with those obtained by more computationally expensive adaptive sampling protocols. While n-body information theory analysis of these simulations confirmed that MetaD can efficiently characterize ligand-induced allosteric communication across the receptor, standard MetaD cannot be used directly to derive kinetic rates because transitions are accelerated by a bias potential. Applying the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) to the free-energy landscape of morphine-bound MOR reconstructed from MetaD, we obtained Markov state models that yield kinetic rates of MOR activation in agreement with those obtained by adaptive sampling. Taken together, these results suggest that the MetaD-MaxCal combination creates an efficient strategy for estimating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of GPCR activation at an affordable computational cost.

The crystal structure of PfA-M1 with bestatin bound within its active site has been determined; however, dynamics of the inhibitor and the association or dissociation pathway have yet to be characterized. Here we present an all-atom molecular dynamics study where we have generated a hidden Markov state model from 2.3 mu s of molecular dynamics simulation. Our hidden Markov state model identifies five macrostates that clearly show the events involved in bestatin dissociation from the PfA-M1 active site. The results show for the first time that bestatin can escape the substrate specificity pockets of the enzyme, primarily due to weak interactions within the pockets.

A prototypical and well studied example is loop opening and closure in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which is thought to determine the rate of catalytic turnover in many circumstances. Specifically, TIM loop 6 grips the phosphodianion of the substrate and, together with a change in loop 7, sets up the TIM active site for efficient catalysis. Crystal structures of TIM typically show an open or a closed conformation of loop 6, with the tip of the loop moving similar to 7 angstrom between conformations. Many studies have interpreted this motion as a two-state, rigid-body transition. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations, with both conventional and enhanced sampling techniques, to analyze loop motion in apo and substrate-bound TIM in detail, using five crystal structures of the 4 dimeric TIM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that loop 6 is highly flexible and samples multiple conformational states. Empirical valence bond simulations of the first reaction step show that slight displacements away from the fully closed-loop conformation can be sufficient to abolish most of the catalytic activity; full closure is required for efficient reaction. The conformational change of the loops in TIM is thus not a simple open and shut case and is crucial for its catalytic action. Our detailed analysis of loop motion in a highly efficient enzyme highlights the complexity of loop conformational changes and their role in biological catalysis.","[Liao, Qinghua; Kulkarni, Yashraj; Petrovic, Dusan; Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn] Uppsala Univ, Dept Chem BMC, BMC Box 576, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden; [Sengupta, Ushnish; Petrovic, Dusan; Strodel, Birgit] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Complex Syst Struct Biochem ICS 6, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Sengupta, Ushnish] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, German Res Sch Simulat Sci, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Mulholland, Adrian J.; van der Kamp, Marc W.] Univ Bristol, Sch Chem, Ctr Computat Chem, Cantocks Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [van der Kamp, Marc W.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biochem, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England","Kamerlin, SCL (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Chem BMC, BMC Box 576, S-75123 Uppsala, Sweden.",lynn.kamerlin@kemi.uu.se,"Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn/G-9554-2011; Liao, Qinghua/AAC-6393-2020; van der Kamp, Marc/AAJ-8176-2020; van der Kamp, Marc/F-6000-2013; Strodel, Birgit/H-5449-2013","Kamerlin, Shina Caroline Lynn/0000-0002-3190-1173; Liao, Qinghua/0000-0002-2260-8493; Kulkarni, Yashraj/0000-0002-7643-9867; van der Kamp, Marc/0000-0002-8060-3359; Petrovic, Dusan/0000-0002-1834-7358; Sengupta, Ushnish/0000-0003-2633-946X; Strodel, Birgit/0000-0002-8734-7765; Mulholland, Adrian/0000-0003-1015-4567","Swedish Research Council (VR)Swedish Research Council [2015-04298]; Human Frontier Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0041/2017]; Sven and Lilly Lawski Foundation for Natural Sciences Research; BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M026280/1]; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M022609/1]; Jurgen Manchot Foundation; Strategischer Forschungsfonds of the Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf [F2014/730-11]; Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) [2016/1-293, 2017/12-11]; BrisSynBio [BB/L01386X/1]; Forschungszentrum JulichHelmholtz Association [ICS69]","This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR, grant 2015-04298), the Human Frontier Science Program (grant RGP0041/2017), the Sven and Lilly Lawski Foundation for Natural Sciences Research (fellowship to Y.K.).

Namely, how do alternative sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence predictions generated from the data? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: (1) a single long simulation, (2) many short simulations run in parallel, (3) adaptive sampling, and (4) our recently developed goal-oriented sampling algorithm, FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering select states on simple landscapes, where we uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize the probability of discovering particular states and transition pathways for each of the four methods. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover each target state with the highest probability, while traversing realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the potential pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate. We refer to this pathology as pathway tunneling. To protect against this phenomenon when using adaptive-sampling and FAST simulations, we introduce the FAST-string method. This method enhances sampling along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare the performance of a variety of MSM estimators in describing accurate thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend simply normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding small pseudocounts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate whether our insights from simple landscapes hold for all atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the lambda-repressor protein. Remarkably, we find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as a set of long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.","[Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Porter, Justin R.; Sun, Xianqiang; Silva, Roseane R.; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",bowman@biochem.wustl.edu,,"Porter, Justin/0000-0002-0340-951X","NSF CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [MCB-1552471]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM12400701]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was funded by NSF CAREER Award MCB-1552471 and NIH R01GM12400701.,,83,12,12,0,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

Here, the interactions between carboxylate side chains and ions lead to an interplay of peptide conformations and ion structuring in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations are an ideal tool to mechanistically investigate these processes. Unfortunately, the formation of strong ion-peptide contacts and ion bridges drastically impedes structural reorganization of ionic bonds and conformational transitions of the polymers. Thus, to obtain a complete thermodynamical picture of such systems, enhanced sampling techniques become necessary as well as the methods to characterize the conformational states of these partially disordered polymer-ion systems. Here, we propose a new set of Hamiltonian replica exchange (HRE) parameters for efficient simulations of peptide ion systems, with an aspartic acid trimer in the presence of Ca2+ and Cl- ions as a test system. We introduce dimensionality reduction and clustering strategies to characterize the states of such a multicomponent system and to analyze the outcome of the proposed HRE with different reweighting methods.","[Lemke, Tobias; Peter, Christine; Kukharenko, Oleksandra] Univ Konstanz, Theoret Chem, D-78547 Constance, Germany","Peter, C; Kukharenko, O (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Theoret Chem, D-78547 Constance, Germany.",Christine.Peter@uni-konstanz.de; Oleksandra.Kukharenko@uni-konstanz.de,"Kukharenko, Oleksandra/AAU-2831-2020","Kukharenko, Oleksandra/0000-0002-3285-1403",Zukunftskolleg of the University of Konstanz; Carl Zeiss Foundation; SFB1214 from the German Research Foundation; state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC; German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [INST 35/1134-1 FUGG],This work was supported by a fellowship of the Zukunftskolleg of the University of Konstanz and the Carl Zeiss Foundation to O.K. and by the SFB1214 funded from the German Research Foundation.

In a recent publication, precise defining characteristics of such reaction coordinates were identified and linked to the existence of a so-called transition manifold. This theory gives rise to a novel numerical method for the pointwise computation of reaction coordinates that relies on short parallel MD simulations only, but yields accurate approximation of the long time behavior of the system under consideration. This article presents an extension of the method towards practical applicability in computational chemistry. It links the newly defined reaction coordinates to concepts from transition path theory and Markov state model building. The main result is an alternative computational scheme that allows for a global computation of reaction coordinates based on commonly available types of simulation data, such as single long molecular trajectories or the push-forward of arbitrary canonically distributed point clouds. It is based on a Galerkin approximation of the transition manifold reaction coordinates that can be tuned to individual requirements by the choice of the Galerkin ansatz functions. Moreover, we propose a ready-to-implement variant of the new scheme, which computes data-fitted, mesh-free ansatz functions directly from the available simulation data. The efficacy of the new method is demonstrated on a small protein system.

Considering the distribution P(x) of the CVs, the primal goal of a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic features of P(x), in particular, its maxima and their connection paths. This is because these features characterize the low-energy regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding free energy landscape Delta G(x) = -k(B)T In P(x), and therefore amount to the metastable states and transition regions of the system. In this perspective, we outline a systematic strategy to identify CVs and metastable states, which subsequently can be employed to construct a Langevin or a Markov state model of the dynamics. In particular, we account for the still limited sampling typically achieved by molecular dynamics simulations, which in practice seriously limits the applicability of theories (e.g., assuming ergodicity) and black-box software tools (e.g., using redundant input coordinates). We show that it is essential to use internal (rather than Cartesian) input coordinates, employ dimensionality reduction methods that avoid rescaling errors (such as principal component analysis), and perform density based (rather than k-means-type) clustering. Finally, we briefly discuss a machine learning approach to dimensionality reduction, which highlights the essential internal coordinates of a system and may reveal hidden reaction mechanisms.

They also constitute an excellent model system for the difficult problem of understanding how allosteric mutations can augment catalytic activity of already-competent enzymes. Multiple allosteric mutations have been identified that alter catalytic activity or drug-resistance spectrum in class A beta lactamases, but predicting these in advance continues to be challenging. Here, we review computational techniques based on structure and/or molecular simulation to predict such mutations. Structure-based techniques have been particularly helpful in developing graph algorithms for analyzing critical residues in beta-lactamase function, while classical molecular simulation has recently shown the ability to prospectively predict allosteric mutations increasing beta-lactamase activity and drug resistance. These will ultimately achieve the greatest power when combined with simulation methods that model reactive chemistry to calculate activation free energies directly.","[Cortina, George A.; Kassont, Peter M.] Univ Virginia, Dept Mol Physiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Cortina, George A.; Kassont, Peter M.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA; [Kassont, Peter M.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Sci Life Lab, S-75146 Uppsala, Sweden","Kassont, PM (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Mol Physiol, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.; Kassont, PM (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22908 USA.; Kassont, PM (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, Sci Life Lab, S-75146 Uppsala, Sweden.",kasson@virginia.edu,,"Cortina, George/0000-0002-5997-0015","National Institutes of Health fellowshipUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F31 GM113543]; Hartwell Foundation; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, F31GM113543, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, F31GM113543, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267, T32GM007267] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors thank Jennifer Hays for many helpful discussions.

The recently obtained crystal structure of PepT(So) provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain an understanding of functional insights of the substrate transport mechanism. Binding of the proton and peptide molecule induces conformational changes into occluded (OC) and outward-facing (OF) states, which we are able to characterize using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The structural knowledge of the OC and OF state is important to fully understand the major energy barrier associated with the transport cycle. In order to gain functional insight into the interstate dynamics, we performed extensive all atom MD simulations. The Markov state model was constructed to identify the free energy barriers between the states, and kinetic information on intermediate pathways was obtained using the transition pathway theory (TPT). TPT shows that the OF state is obtained by the movement of TM1 and TM7 at the extracellular side approximately 12-16 angstrom away from each other, and the inward movement of TM4 and TM10 at the intracellular halves to 3-4 angstrom characterizes the OC state. Helix distance distributions obtained from MD simulations were compared with experimental double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and were found to be in excellent agreement with previous studies. We also predicted the optimal positions for placement of methane thiosulfonate spin label probes to capture the slowest protein dynamics. Our finding sheds light on the conformational cycle of this key membrane transporter and the functional relationships between the multiple intermediate states.","[Selvam, Balaji; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mittal, Shriyaa; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,"Mittal, Shriyaa/I-8121-2019","Mittal, Shriyaa/0000-0003-3490-1969; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381; Selvam, Balaji/0000-0002-7677-290X","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; CSE Fellows Program; Computational Science and Engineering at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA","Authors thank the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (Awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

Applying pulling forces of only 5 pN, we maintain gpW in quasi-equilibrium near its mechanical unfolding midpoint and detect how it interconverts stochastically between the folded and an extended state.

Despite being the target of numerous theoretical and computational studies for understanding the protein folding, the set of CVs optimally characterizing the conformational landscape of the ) 6-hairpin of GB1 protein has remained elusive, resulting in a lack of consensus on its folding mechanism. Here we address this by proposing a pair of optimal CVs which can resolve the underlying free energy landscape of the GB1 hairpin quite efficiently. Expressed as a linear combination of a number of traditional CVs, the optimal CV for this system is derived by employing the recently introduced time-structured independent component analysis approach on a large number of independent unbiased simulations. By projecting the replica-exchange simulated trajectories along these pair of optimized CVs, the resulting free energy landscape of this system is able to resolve four distinct well-separated metastable states encompassing the extensive ensembles of folded, unfolded, and molten globule states. Importantly, the optimized CVs were found to be capable of automatically recovering a novel partial helical state of this protein, without needing to explicitly invoke helicity as a constituent CV. Furthermore, a quantitative sensitivity analysis of each constituent in the optimized CV provided key insights on the relative contributions of the constituent CVs in the overall free energy landscapes. Finally, the kinetic pathways connecting these metastable states, constructed using a Markov state model, provide an optimum description of the underlying folding mechanism of the peptide. Taken together, this work offers a quantitatively robust approach toward comprehensive mapping of the underlying folding landscape of a quintessential model system along its optimized CV.

Traditionally, the oncogenic properties of KRAS missense mutants at position 12 (G12X) have been considered as equal. Here, by assessing the probabilities of occurrence of all KRAS G12X mutations and KRAS dynamics we show that this assumption does not hold true. Instead, our findings revealed an outstanding mutational bias. We conducted a thorough mutational analysis of KRAS G12X mutations and assessed to what extent the observed mutation frequencies follow a random distribution. Unique tissue-specific frequencies are displayed with specific mutations, especially with G12R, which cannot be explained by random probabilities. To clarify the underlying causes for the nonrandom probabilities, we conducted extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (170 its) to study the differences of G12X mutations on a molecular level. The simulations revealed an allosteric hydrophobic signaling network in KRAS, and that protein dynamics is altered among the G12X mutants and as such differs from the wild-type and is mutation-specific. The shift in long-timescale conformational dynamics was confirmed with Markov state modeling. A G12X mutation was found to modify KRAS dynamics in an allosteric way, which is especially manifested in the switch regions that are responsible for the effector protein binding. The findings provide a basis to understand better the oncogenic properties of KRAS G12X mutants and the consequences of the observed nonrandom frequencies of specific G12X mutations.","[Pantsar, Tatu; Laitinen, Tuomo; Poso, Antti] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, Kuopio, Finland; [Rissanen, Sami; Vattulainen, Ilpo] Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Phys, Tampere, Finland; [Dauch, Daniel; Poso, Antti] Univ Hosp Tuebingen, Dept Internal Med 8, Tubingen, Germany; [Dauch, Daniel] Eberhard Karls Univ Tuebingen, Inst Physiol, Dept Physiol 1, Tubingen, Germany; [Vattulainen, Ilpo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Vattulainen, Ilpo] MEMPHYS, Ctr Biomembrane Phys, Helsinki, Finland","Pantsar, T; Poso, A (corresponding author), Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, Kuopio, Finland.; Poso, A (corresponding author), Univ Hosp Tuebingen, Dept Internal Med 8, Tubingen, Germany.",tatu.pantsar@uef.fi; antti.poso@uef.fi,"Vattulainen, Ilpo T/G-4224-2014","Pantsar, Tatu/0000-0002-0369-2909; Poso, Antti/0000-0003-4196-4204; Laitinen, Tuomo/0000-0003-1539-2142; Vattulainen, Ilpo/0000-0001-7408-3214","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [276509, 307415]; Biocenter Finland/DDCB; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [290974]; Graduate School program of Tampere University of Technology; Alfred Kordelin Foundation","The study was supported by the Academy of Finland (http://www.aka.fi/en) (grant 276509 to AP) and Biocenter Finland/DDCB (http://ddcb.fi/en/ddcb/biocenter_finland/) (TL).

Although the crystal diffraction technique has greatly contributed to our understanding of the structures of the involved transporters, a description of the dynamic transport mechanism at the single-molecule level has been extremely elusive. In this study, we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based force tracing to directly monitor the transport of a single molecule, D-glucose, across living cell membranes. Our results show that the force to transport a single molecule of D-glucose across cell membranes is 37 +/- 9 pN, and the corresponding transport interval is approximately 20 ms, while the average speed is approximately 0.3 mu m s(-1). Furthermore, our calculated force profile from molecular dynamics simulations showed quantitatively good agreement with the force tracing observation and revealed detailed information regarding the glucose transport path, indicating that two salt bridges, K38/E299 and K300/E426, play critical roles during glucose transport across glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). This role was further verified using biological experiments that disrupted these two bridges and measured the uptake of glucose into the cells. Our approaches led to the first unambiguous description of the glucose transport process across cell membranes at the single-molecule level and demonstrated the biological importance of the two salt bridges for transporting glucose across GLUT1.","[Pan, Yangang; Zhang, Qingrong; Wang, Hongda] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Res Ctr Biomembran, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Jilin 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hongda] Qing Dao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Biol & Biotechnol, Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuebin; Huang, Siteng; Li, Guohui] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Mol React Dynam, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Gongpan, Pianchou; Xiong, Wenyong] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Phytochem & Plant Resources West Ch, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingrong; Shan, Yuping] Adv Inst Mat Sci, Sch Chem & Life Sci, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin; Xu, Bingqian] Univ Georgia, Single Mol Study Lab, Coll Engn, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wang, Bin; Xu, Bingqian] Univ Georgia, Nanoscale Sci & Engn Ctr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Gongpan, Pianchou; Wang, Hongda] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100019, Peoples R China","Wang, HD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Res Ctr Biomembran, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Jilin 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Wang, HD (corresponding author), Qing Dao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Biol & Biotechnol, Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Li, GH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Mol React Dynam, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, Peoples R China.; Xiong, WY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Phytochem & Plant Resources West Ch, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.; Shan, YP (corresponding author), Adv Inst Mat Sci, Sch Chem & Life Sci, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Wang, HD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Univ, Beijing 100019, Peoples R China.",shanyp@ciac.ac.cn; xiong.wenyong@mail.kib.ac.cn; ghli@dicp.ac.cn; hdwang@ciac.ac.cn,"xiong, wenyong/C-3835-2013","xiong, wenyong/0000-0001-9174-3667","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0505300]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21727816, 21525314, 21721003, 21573217, 31330082, 21673023]; Science and Technology Department of Yunnan Province [2017FA044, 2013HA023]; Jilin Provincial Science Research Foundation of China [20160520133JH]","We thank Prof. Stuart Lindsay for providing helpful comments and assistance.

In particular, short in-frame insertion mutations within a conserved alpha C-beta 4 loop in the EGFR kinase domain are frequently observed in tumor samples and patients harboring these mutations are insensitive to first-generation EGFR inhibitors. Despite the prevalence and clinical relevance of insertion mutations, the mechanisms by which these mutations regulate EGFR activity and contribute to drug sensitivity are poorly understood. Using cell-based mutation screening, we find that the precise location, length, and sequence of the inserted segment are critical for ligand-independent EGFR activation and downstream signaling. We identify three insertion mutations (N771 P772insN, D770_N771insG, and D770 > GY) that activate EGFR in a unique way by relying more on the acceptor interface for kinase activation. Our drug inhibition studies indicate that these activating insertion mutations respond more favorably to osimertinib, a recently Food and Drug Administration-approved EGFR inhibitor for T790M-positive patients with lung cancer. Molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling of WT and mutant EGFR suggest a model in which activating insertion mutations increase catalytic activity by relieving key autoinhibitory interactions associated with alpha C-helix movement and by lowering the transition free energy (Delta G(active-inactive)) between active and inactive states. Our studies also identify a transition state sampled by activating insertion mutations that can be exploited in the design of mutant-selective EGFR inhibitors.","[Ruan, Zheng; Kannan, Natarajan] Univ Georgia, Inst Bioinformat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Kannan, Natarajan] Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Kannan, N (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Inst Bioinformat, Athens, GA 30602 USA.; Kannan, N (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",nkannan@uga.edu,,"Ruan, Zheng/0000-0002-4412-4916","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [5RO1GM114409]; 2017 Innovative and Interdisciplinary Research Grant for Doctoral Students at the University of Georgia; Georgia Advanced Computing Resource Center; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM114409, R01GM114409, R01GM114409, R01GM114409] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We acknowledge the constructive feedback from Dr. Robert J.

A major concern is the speed of development of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance in Gram-negative species, thus putting at risk the efficacy of the most recently approved antibiotics and inhibitors, including carbapenems and avibactam, respectively. New strategies to overcome resistance are urgently required, which will ultimately be facilitated by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the function of beta-lactamases such as the Klebsiella Pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs). Using enhanced sampling computational methods together with site-directed mutagenesis, we report the identification of two hydrophobic networks in the KPC-2 enzyme, the integrity of which has been found to be essential for protein stability and corresponding resistance. Present throughout the structure, these networks are responsible for the structural integrity and allosteric signaling. Disruption of the networks leads to a loss of the KPC-2 mediated resistance phenotype, resulting in restored susceptibility to different classes of beta-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems and cephalosporins. The hydrophobic networks were found to be highly conserved among class-A beta-lactamases, which implies their suitability for exploitation as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","[Galdadas, Ioannis; Gervasio, Francesco L.] UCL, Dept Chem, London, England; [Lovera, Silvia] UCB Pharma, UCB BioPharma, Discovery Chem, New Med, B-1420 Braine Lalleud, Belgium; [Perez-Hernandez, Guillermo] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Barnes, Melissa D.; Bonomo, Robert A.] Case Western Reserve Univ & Res Serv, Louis Stokes Cleveland Dept Vet Affairs, Dept Med, Cleveland, OH USA; [Gervasio, Francesco L.] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London, England; [Woodford, Neil] Publ Hlth England, Antimicrobial Resistance & Healthcare Associated, Natl Infect Serv, London, England; [Healy, Jess; Afsharikho, Hamidreza; Haider, Shozeb] UCL, UCL Sch Pharm, London, England","Haider, S (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Sch Pharm, London, England.",shozeb.haider@ucl.ac.uk,"Haider, Shozeb/Q-1599-2019","Haider, Shozeb/0000-0003-2650-2925; Galdadas, Ioannis/0000-0003-2136-9723; Healy, Jess/0000-0001-7437-1742; Gervasio, Francesco Luigi/0000-0003-4831-5039; Perez-Hernandez, Guillermo/0000-0002-9287-8704","Astra Zeneca-EPSRC; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P022138/1, EP/P011306/1, EP/M013898/1]; Veterans AffairsUS Department of Veterans Affairs [I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974, I01BX001974] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","S.H. and F.L.G. would like to thank Astra Zeneca-EPSRC case studentship award to I.G.

Our long-timescale MD simulations identify key conformational states not previously observed by means of X-ray crystallography and short MD simulations that present the loop containing one of the catalytic residues, Asp239, in a wide-open conformation, which is likely involved in the binding of the epoxide substrate. Introduction of mutations M145S and F128A dramatically alters the conformational landscape of the enzyme. These singly mutated variants can accept bulky epoxide substrates due to the disorder induced by mutation in the alpha-helix containing the catalytic Tyr144 and some parts of the lid domain.

Gaussian functions are added along relevant coordinates on the fly during a molecular-dynamics simulation to force the system to escape from minima in the potential energy function. The dynamics in the resulting trajectory are however unphysical and cannot be used directly to estimate dynamical properties of the system. Girsanov reweighting is a recent method used to construct the Markov State Model (MSM) of a system subjected to an external perturbation. With the combination of these two techniques-metadynamics/Girsanov-reweighting-the unphysical dynamics in a metadynamics simulation can be reweighted to obtain the MSM of the unbiased system. We demonstrate the method on a one-dimensional diffusion process, alanine dipeptide, and the hexapeptide Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG).

Typically, however, multiple lagtimes are used and analyzed as input parameters, yet convergence with respect to the choice of lagtime is not always possible. Here, we present a simple method for calculating the slowest relaxation time (RT) of the system in the limit of very long lagtimes. Our approach relies on the fact that the second eigenvector's autocorrelation function of the propagator will be approximately single exponential at long lagtimes. This allows us to obtain a simple equation for the behavior of the MSM's relaxation time as a function of the lagtime with only two free parameters, one of these being the RT of the system. We demonstrate that the second parameter is a useful indicator of how Markovian a selected variable is for building the MSM. Fitting this function to data gives a limiting value for the optimal variational RT. Testing this on analytic and molecular dynamics data for AlaS and umbrella sampling-biased ion channel simulations shows that the function accurately describes the behavior of the RT and furthermore that this RT can improve noticeably the value calculated at the longest accessible lagtime. We compare our RT limit to the hidden Markov model (HMM) approach that typically finds RTs of comparable values. However, HMMs cannot be used in conjunction with biased simulation data, requiring more complex algorithms to construct than MSMs, and the derived RTs are not variational, leading to ambiguity in the choice of lagtime at which to build the HMM.

The aptamer domain of TPP riboswitch detects the high abundance of coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and modulates the gene expression for thiamine synthetic gene. The mechanistic understanding in recognition of TPP in aptamer domain and ligand-induced compactness for folding of expression platform are most important to designing novel modulators. To understand the dynamic behavior of TPP riboswitch upon TPP binding, molecular dynamics simulations were performed for 400 ns in both apo and TPP bound forms of thiM riboswitch from E. coli and analyzed in terms of eRMSD-based Markov state modeling and residual fluctuation network. Markov state models show good correlations in transition probability among metastable states from simulated trajectory and generated models. Structural compactness in TPP bound form is observed which is correlated with SAXS experiment. The importance of junction of P4 and PS is evident during dynamics, which correlates with FRET analysis. The dynamic nature of two sensor forearms is due to the flexible P1 helix, which is its intrinsic property. The transient state in TPP-bound form was observed in the Markov state model, along with stable states. We believe that this transient state is responsible to assist the influx and outflux of ligand molecule by creating a solvent channel around the junction region of P4 and PS and such a structure was anticipated in FRET analysis. The dynamic nature of riboswitch is dependent on the interaction between residues on distal loops L3 and LS/P3 and junction P4 and PS, J3/2 which stabilize the J2/4. It helps in the transfer of allosteric information between J2/4 and P3/L5 tertiary docking region through the active site residues. Understanding such information flow will benefit in highlighting crucial residues in highly dynamic and kinetic systems. Here, we report the residues and segments in riboswitch that play vital roles in providing stability and this can be exploited in designing inhibitors to regulate the functioning of riboswitches.","[Kesherwani, Manish; Kutumbarao, N.

However, gene networks often have dynamics characterized by multiple attractors. Stochastic simulation is often inefficient for such systems, because most of the simulation time is spent waiting for rare, barrier-crossing events to occur. We present a rare-event simulation-based method for computing epigenetic landscapes and phenotype-transitions in metastable gene networks. Our computational pipeline was inspired by studies of metastability and barrier-crossing in protein folding, and provides an automated means of computing and visualizing essential stationary and dynamic information that is generally inaccessible to conventional simulation. Applied to a network model of pluripotency in Embryonic Stem Cells, our simulations revealed rare phenotypes and approximately Markovian transitions among phenotype-states, occurring with a broad range of timescales. The relative probabilities of phenotypes and the transition paths linking pluripotency and differentiation are sensitive to global kinetic parameters governing transcription factor-DNA binding kinetics. Our approach significantly expands the capability of stochastic simulation to investigate gene regulatory network dynamics, which may help guide rational cell reprogramming strategies. Our approach is also generalizable to other types of molecular networks and stochastic dynamics frameworks.","[Tse, Margaret J.; Chu, Brian K.; Gallivan, Cameron P.; Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",elread@uci.edu,,"Read, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9186-284X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS 1715455],"The research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation [https://www.nsf.gov DMS 1715455 to ELR].

The growth of amyloid fibers is strongly thermodynamically favorable, but kinetic traps exist where the incoming monomer binds in an incompatible conformation that blocks further elongation.

It is also too complex to simulate in full detail and to date has been explored either through coarse-grained simulations, which may miss many important interactions, or full atomic simulations, in which the incoming peptide is constrained to be near the ideal fiber geometry. Here we use an alternate approach starting from a docked complex in which the monomer is from an experimental NMR structure of one of the major conformations in the unbound ensemble, a largely unstructured peptide with the central hydrophobic region in a 3(10) helix. A 1000 ns full atomic simulation in explicit solvent shows the formation of a metastable intermediate by sequential, concerted movements of both the fiber and the monomer.

Spectroscopic studies have indicated relationships between protein and solvent dynamics, and rates of gas binding to heme proteins in aqueous solution were previously observed to depend inversely on solution viscosity. In this work, the solvent-compatible enzyme Cane/Ida antarctica lipase B, which functions in aqueous and organic solvents, was modeled using molecular dynamics simulations. Data was obtained for the enzyme in acetonitrile, cyclohexane, n-butanol, and tert-butanol, in addition to water. Protein dynamics and solvation shell dynamics are characterized regionally: for each alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and loop or connector region. Correlations are seen between solvent mobility and protein flexibility. So, does local viscosity explain the relationship between protein structural dynamics and solvation layer dynamics? Halle and Davidovic presented a cogent analysis of data describing the global hydrodynamics of a protein (tumbling in solution) that fits a model in which the protein's interfacial viscosity is higher than that of bulk water's, due to retarded water dynamics in the hydration layer (measured in NMR tau 2 reorientation times). Numerous experiments have shown coupling between protein and solvation layer dynamics in site-specific measurements. Our data provides spatially-resolved characterization of solvent shell dynamics, showing correlations between regional solvation layer dynamics and protein dynamics in both aqueous and organic solvents. Correlations between protein flexibility and inverse solvent viscosity (1/eta) are considered across several protein regions and for a rather disparate collection of solvents. It is seen that the correlation is consistently higher when local solvent shell dynamics are considered, rather than bulk viscosity. Protein flexibility is seen to correlate best with either the local interfacial viscosity or the ratio of the mobility of an organic solvent in a regional solvation layer relative to hydration dynamics around the same region. Results provide insight into the function of aqueous proteins, while also suggesting a framework for interpreting and predicting enzyme structural dynamics in non-aqueous solvents, based on the mobility of solvents within the solvation layer. We suggest that Kramers' theory may be used in future work to model protein conformational transitions in different solvents by incorporating local viscosity effects.","[Dahanayake, Jayangika N.; Mitchell-Koch, Katie R.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Chem, Wichita, KS 67208 USA","Mitchell-Koch, KR (corresponding author), Wichita State Univ, Dept Chem, Wichita, KS 67208 USA.",katie.mitchell-koch@wichita.edu,,"Mitchell-Koch, Katie/0000-0002-9173-3677","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EPS-0903806, CHE-1665157, ACI-1548562]; Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; State of Kansas through the Kansas Board of Regents; National Institute of General Medical Sciences from the National Institutes of Health [P20 GM103418]; Wichita State University Department of Chemistry; American Chemical Society Petroleum Research FundAmerican Chemical Society; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418, P20GM103418] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",Acknowledgment is made to the donors of the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund for support of this research.

However, the state-of-the-art Markov state modeling methods and tools enforce the fulfillment of a detailed balance condition, restricting their applicability to equilibrium MSMs. To date, they are unsuitable to deal with general dominant data structures including cyclic processes, which are essentially associated with nonequilibrium systems. To overcome this limitation, we developed a generalization of the common robust Pen-on Cluster Cluster Analysis (PCCA+) method, termed generalized PCCA (G-PCCA). This method handles equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulation data, utilizing Schur vectors instead of eigenvectors. G-PCCA is not limited to the detection of metastable states but enables the identification of dominant structures in a general sense, unraveling cyclic processes. This is exemplified by application of G-PCCA on nonequilibrium molecular dynamics data of the Amyloid beta (1-40) peptide, periodically driven by an oscillating electric field.","[Reuter, Bernhard; Garcia, Martin E.] Univ Kassel, Inst Phys, Theoret Phys 2, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany; [Reuter, Bernhard; Weber, Marcus; Fackeldey, Konstantin; Roeblitz, Susanna] ZIB, Takustr 7, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Fackeldey, Konstantin] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Str 17 Juni 136, D-10623 Berlin, Germany","Reuter, B (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Inst Phys, Theoret Phys 2, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany.; Reuter, B (corresponding author), ZIB, Takustr 7, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",b.reuterp@uni-kassel.de,"Garcia, Martin E/D-2697-2009","Roblitz, Susanna/0000-0002-2735-0030",University of Kassel,B.R. is grateful to the University of Kassel for financial support granted to him within a Ph.D. scholarship and within the framework of the PhosMOrg project.,,64,3,3,2,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

However, coarse models involve approximations that may affect their predictive power. We propose a modeling framework that allows us to design simplified models to accurately reproduce experimental observables. We demonstrate the approach on the folding mechanism of a WW domain. We show that when the correct coarsening resolution is used not only do the optimized models match the Reference model simulated experimental data accurately but additional observables not directly targeted during the optimization procedure are also reproduced. Additionally, the analysis of the results shows that localized frustration plays an important role in the folding mechanism of this protein and suggests that nontrivial aspects of the protein dynamics are evolutionary conserved.","[Chen, Justin] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Jiming; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Pinamonti, Giovanni; Clementi, Cecilia] Freie Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Justin; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Freie Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",cecilia@rice.edu,"Chen, Jiming/AAA-3575-2020","Chen, Jiming/0000-0003-3155-3145; Chen, Jiming/0000-0001-5232-5382; Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Einstein Foundation in Berlin; Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]","We are grateful to D.

In recent years, it has been demonstrated that allosteric mechanisms can be understood by the conformational ensembles of a protein. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are often used for the study of protein allostery as they provide an atomistic view of the dynamics of a protein. However, given the wealth of detailed information hidden in MD data, one has to apply a method that allows extraction of the conformational ensembles underlying allosteric regulation from these data. Markov state models are one of the most promising methods for this purpose. We provide a short introduction to the theory of Markov state models and review their application to various examples of protein allostery studied by MD simulations. We also include a discussion of studies where Markov modelling has been employed to analyse experimental data on allosteric regulation. We conclude our review by advertising the wider application of Markov state models to elucidate allosteric mechanisms, especially since in recent years it has become straightforward to construct such models thanks to software programs like PyEMMA and MSMBuilder.

By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suitable but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B reversible arrow C). Applications on a toy model and CO diffusion into the heme cavity of myoglobin are reported.

A common trend in these studies is the introduction of multiple scattered mutations remote from the active site. Rationalizing how distal mutations influence the conformational states or ensemble of conformations formed by enzymes, and its relation to enzymatic catalysis is highly appealing for the improvement of current rational enzyme design strategies. Directed evolution was applied to convert d-sialic acid aldolase into an efficient l-3-deoxy-manno-2-octulosonic acid (l-KDO) aldolase. In this study, we computationally evaluate the conformational dynamics of both enzymes to shed light on the specificity of the evolved variant. We further demonstrate the role of distal mutations on the modulation of enzyme conformational dynamics and its relation to substrate accessibility and selectivity. Mutations markedly altered the active site shape and substrate access tunnels in the evolved l-KDO aldolase, thus affecting the enzyme specificity.","[Romero-Rivera, Adrian; Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier; Osuna, Silvia] Univ Girona, IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain; [Romero-Rivera, Adrian; Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier; Osuna, Silvia] Univ Girona, Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain; [Osuna, Silvia] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Iglesias-Fernandez, J; Osuna, S (corresponding author), Univ Girona, IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain.; Iglesias-Fernandez, J; Osuna, S (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain.; Osuna, S (corresponding author), ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain.",jiglesiasfrn@gmail.com; silvia.osuna@udg.edu,"Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier/AAF-1019-2019","Iglesias-Fernandez, Javier/0000-0001-7773-2945; Osuna, Silvia/0000-0003-3657-6469; Romero, Adrian/0000-0002-0387-2774","Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2015-FI-B-00165]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [H2020-MSCA-IF-2016-753045, PCIG14-GA-2013-630978]; Spanish MINECO [CTQ2014-59212-P]; Ramon y CajalSpanish Government [RYC-2014-16846]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2015StG- 679001]","A.

TDG is involved in cytosine demethylation at CpG sites in DNA. Here we have used molecular modeling to delineate the lesion search and DNA base interrogation mechanisms of TDG. First, we examined the capacity of TDG to interrogate not only DNA substrates with 5-carboxyl cytosine modifications but also G:T mismatches and nonmismatched (A:T) base pairs using classical and accelerated molecular dynamics. To determine the kinetics, we constructed Markov state models. Base interrogation was found to be highly stochastic and proceeded through insertion of an arginine-containing loop into the DNA minor groove to transiently disrupt Watson-Crick pairing. Next, we employed chain-of-replicas path-sampling methodologies to compute minimum free energy paths for TDG base extrusion. We identified the key intermediates imparting selectivity and determined effective free energy profiles for the lesion search and base extrusion into the TDG active site. Our results show that DNA sculpting, dynamic glycosylase interactions, and stabilizing contacts collectively provide a powerful mechanism for the detection and discrimination of modified bases and epigenetic marks in DNA.","[Dodd, Thomas; Yan, Chunli; Kossmann, Bradley R.; Martin, Kurt; Ivanov, Ivaylo] Georgia State Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Dodd, Thomas; Yan, Chunli; Kossmann, Bradley R.; Martin, Kurt; Ivanov, Ivaylo] Georgia State Univ, Ctr Diagnost & Therapeut, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Kossmann, Bradley R.] 360i, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA","Ivanov, I (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Chem, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.; Ivanov, I (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Ctr Diagnost & Therapeut, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",iivanov@gsu.edu,"Ivanov, Ivaylo/A-7613-2013","Ivanov, Ivaylo/0000-0002-5306-1005","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM110387]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1149521]; National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment program [CHE110042]; Department of Energy Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM110387, R01GM110387, R01GM110387, R01GM110387, R01GM110387] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM110387 and National Science Foundation Grant MCB-1149521.

Crystallographically, whereas both substrates and inhibitors have been found to bind in the central binding (S1) site of NSS, inhibitors were found to bind to a second binding (S2) site in the extracellular vestibule (EV) of transporters for leucine (LeuT) and serotonin. On the basis of computational and experimental studies, we proposed that substrates bind to the S2 site of LeuT as well and that substrate binding to the S2 site is essential for Na+-coupled symport. Recent binding experiments show that substrate (L-Trp) binding in the S2 site of MhsT, another bacterial NSS, is also central to the allosteric transport mechanism. Here, we used extensive molecular dynamics simulations combined with Markov state model analysis to investigate the interaction of L-Trp with the EV of MhsT and identified potential binding poses of L-Trp as well as induced conformational changes in the EV. Our computational findings were validated by experimental mutagenesis studies and shed light on the ligand binding characteristics of the EV of NSS, which may facilitate development of allosteric ligands targeting NSS.","[Abramyan, Ara M.; Xue, Catherine; Shi, Lei] NIDA, Computat Chem & Mol Biophys Unit, Intramural Res Program, NIH, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Psychiat, 722 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Javitch, Jonathan A.] Columbia Univ Coll Phys & Surg, Dept Pharmacol, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Quick, Matthias; Javitch, Jonathan A.] New York State Psychiat Inst & Hosp, Div Mol Therapeut, New York, NY 10032 USA","Shi, L (corresponding author), NIDA, Computat Chem & Mol Biophys Unit, Intramural Res Program, NIH, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",lei.shi2@nih.gov,"Shi, Lei/AAV-1321-2020","Shi, Lei/0000-0002-4137-096X","Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA041510, GM087519]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519, U54GM087519] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606, R01DA041510, R01DA041510, R01DA041510, ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606, R01DA041510] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Support for this research was provided by the Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (A.M.A., C.X., and L.S.), and by NIH grants DA041510 and GM087519 (M.Q and J.A.J.).",,48,2,2,1,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,1549-960X,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.

In this paper, we extend the methodology toward efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by recapturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-ILDN. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the effects of the GTT mutation on the FIP35 WW domain.","[Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Pande@stanford.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-MCB-0954714]; National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [ACI-1429830]; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1429830] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors would like to thank various members of the Pande lab for useful discussions and feedback on the manuscript.

A particularly promising strategy is to combine massive parallel computing of short molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories (to sample the free energy landscape of the system) with Markov state modeling (to rebuild the kinetics from the sampled data). To obtain well-distributed initial structures for the short trajectories, it is proposed to employ metadynamics MD, which quickly sweeps through the entire free energy landscape of interest. Being only used to generate initial conformations, the implementation of metadynamics can be simple and fast. The conformational dynamics of helical peptide Aib(9) is adopted to discuss various technical issues of the approach, including metadynamics settings, minimal number and length of short MD trajectories, and the validation of the resulting Markov models. Using metadynamics to launch some thousands of nanosecond trajectories, several Markov state models are constructed that reveal that previous unbiased MD simulations of in total 16 mu s length cannot provide correct equilibrium populations or qualitative features of the pathway distribution of the short peptide.","[Biswas, Mithun; Lickert, Benjamin; Stock, Gerhard] Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany","Stock, G (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ, Inst Phys, Biomol Dynam, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",stock@physik.uni-freiburg.de,"Biswas, Mithun/I-3773-2018","Lickert, Benjamin/0000-0003-1362-1642; Biswas, Mithun/0000-0002-8204-2954",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [STO 247/11],"We thank Steffen Wolf, Sebastian Buchenberg, and Florian Sittel for many instructive and helpful discussions, Steffen in particular concerning the force field representation of chirality, and Sebastian also for sharing the MD trajectories.

Here, we focus on solving the binding mode prediction problem for rigid fragments. That is, we focus on computing the dominant placement, conformation, and orientations of a relatively rigid, fragment-like ligand in a receptor, and the populations of the multiple binding modes which may be relevant. This problem is important in its own right, but is even more timely given the recent success of alchemical free energy calculations. Alchemical calculations are increasingly used to predict binding free energies of ligands to receptors. However, the accuracy of these calculations is dependent on proper sampling of the relevant ligand binding modes. Unfortunately, ligand binding modes may often be uncertain, hard to predict, and/or slow to interconvert on simulation time scales, so proper sampling with current techniques can require prohibitively long simulations. We need new methods which dramatically improve sampling of ligand binding modes. Here, we develop and apply a nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) method to improve sampling of ligand binding modes. In this technique, the ligand is rotated and subsequently allowed to relax in its new position through alchemical perturbation before accepting or rejecting the rotation and relaxation as a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo move. When applied to a T4 lysozyme model binding system, this NCMC method shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in binding mode sampling efficiency compared to a brute force molecular dynamics simulation. This is a first step toward applying this methodology to pharmaceutically relevant binding of fragments and, eventually, drug-like molecules. We are making this approach available via our new Binding modes of ligands using enhanced sampling (BLUES) package which is freely available on GitHub.","[Gill, Samuel C.; Mobley, David L.] Univ Calif

A challenging problem is to identify the mechanism and kinetics of these binding-induced folding processes in experiments and atomistic simulations. In this Article, we present a detailed picture for the folding of the inhibitor peptide PMI into a helix during binding to the oncoprotein fragment (25-109)Mdm2 obtained from atomistic, explicit-water simulations and Markov state modeling. We find that binding-induced folding of PMI is highly parallel and can occur along a multitude of pathways. Some pathways are induced-fit-like with binding occurring prior to PMI helix formation, while other pathways are conformational-selection-like with binding after helix formation. On the majority of pathways, however, binding is intricately coupled to folding, without clear temporal ordering. A central feature of these pathways is PMI motion on the Mdm2 surface, along the binding groove of Mdm2 or over the rim of this groove. The native binding groove of Mdm2 thus appears as an asymmetric funnel for PMI binding. Overall, binding-induced folding of PMI does not fit into the classical picture of induced fit or conformational selection that implies a clear temporal ordering of binding and folding events. We argue that this holds in general for binding-induced folding processes because binding and folding events in these processes likely occur on similar time scales and do exhibit the time-scale separation required for temporal ordering.","[Paul, Fabian; Weikl, Thomas R.] Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Theory & Biosyst, Sci Pk Golm, D-14424 Potsdam, Germany; [Paul, Fabian; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Paul, F; Weikl, TR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Theory & Biosyst, Sci Pk Golm, D-14424 Potsdam, Germany.; Paul, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",fabian.paul@physik.tu-berlin.de; thomas.weikl@mpikg.mpg.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Weikl, Thomas/0000-0002-0911-5328",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 1114],"This research has been partially funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant CRC 1114 Scaling Cascades in Complex Systems, Project A4 Efficient calculation of slow and stationary scales in molecular dynamics.

Recently, a variant termed the hybrid atomistic model advances the description of backbone and side chain interactions of traditional structure-based models, by borrowing the description of local interactions from classical force fields. In this study, we assessed the validity of this model in the folding problem of human telomericDNAG-quadruplex, where local dihedral terms play important roles. Atwo-state modelwas developed and a set of molecular dynamics simulations was conducted to study the folding dynamics of sequence Htel24, which was experimentally validated to adopt two different (3 + 1) hybrid G-quadruplex topologies in K+ solution. Consistent with the experimental observations, the hybrid1 conformation was found to be more stable and the hybrid-2 conformation was kinetically more favored. The simulations revealed that the hybrid-2 conformation folded in a higher cooperative manner, which may be the reason why it was kinetically more accessible. Moreover, by building a Markov state model, a two-quartet G-quadruplex state and a misfolded state were identified as competing states to complicate the folding process of Htel24. Besides, the simulations also showed that the transition between hybrid-1 and hybrid-2 conformations may proceed an ensemble of hairpin structures. The hybrid atomistic structure-based model reproduced the kinetic partitioning folding dynamics of Htel24 between two different folds, and thus can be used to study the complex folding processes of other G-quadruplex structures.

In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations. As a result of this built-in physics, we observe a rather large restriction in the topology of the networks characterizing the simulation kinetics. When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models. Additionally, an investigation into thermodynamic properties reveals a link between the cooperativity of the transition and the network topology at a single reference temperature.

Initially, free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations revealed that although sodium ions can easily permeate the channel with their first hydration shell almost intact, the selectivity filter is too narrow for efficient conduction of hydrated potassium ions. This steric view of selectivity was subsequently questioned bymicrosecond atomic trajectories, which proved that the selectivity filter appears to the permeating ions as a highly degenerate, liquid-like environment. Although this liquid-like environment looks optimal for rapid conduction of Na+, it seems incompatible with efficient discrimination between similar ion species, such as Na+ and K+, through steric effects. Here extensive molecular dynamics simulations, combined with Markov state model analyses, reveal that at positive membrane potentials, potassium ions trigger a conformational change of the selectivity toward a nonconductive metastable state. It is this transition of the selectivity filter, and not steric effects, that prevents the outward flux of K+ at positive membrane potentials. This description of selectivity, triggered by the nature of the permeating ions, might have implications on the current understanding of how ion channels, and in particular bacterial Na+ channels, operate at the atomic scale.","[Furini, Simone] Univ Siena, Dept Med Biotechnol, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Domene, Carmen] Univ Bath, Dept Chem, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Domene, Carmen] Univ Oxford, Chem Res Lab, Oxford OX1 3TA, England","Furini, S (corresponding author), Univ Siena, Dept Med Biotechnol, I-53100 Siena, Italy.",simone.furini@unisi.it,"Furini, Simone/AAU-6456-2020; Domene, Carmen/A-2711-2019","Furini, Simone/0000-0002-1099-8279; Domene, Carmen/0000-0001-7115-4232","Italian Computing Center, CINECA, under the Italian SuperComputing Resource Allocation initiative [ISCRA-HP10BKVK3K]; Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe, PRACE-3IP Project [FP7 RI-312763]","This work was supported by the Italian Computing Center, CINECA, under the Italian SuperComputing Resource Allocation initiative (ISCRA-HP10BKVK3K).

Here, we use multiple microsecond-long, coarse-grained, biased and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations (a total of similar to 4 milliseconds) combined with multi-ensemble Markov state models to elucidate the kinetics of homodimerization of a prototypic GPCR, the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/cholesterol lipid bilayer. Analysis of these computations identifies kinetically distinct macrostates comprising several different short-lived dimeric configurations of either inactive or activated MOR. Calculated kinetic rates and fractions of dimers at different MOR concentrations suggest a negligible population of MOR homodimers at physiological concentrations, which is supported by acceptor photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments.

So far, geometric order parameters, such as the root mean square deviation, fraction of native amino acid contacts, and collective coordinates that best characterize rare or large conformational transitions, have been prevailing in protein folding studies. Here, we show that the solvent-averaged effective energy, which is a thermodynamic quantity but unambiguously defined for individual protein conformations, serves as a good order parameter of protein folding. This is illustrated through the application to the folding-unfolding simulation trajectory of villin headpiece subdomain. We rationalize the suitability of the effective energy as an order parameter by the funneledness of the underlying protein free energy landscape. We also demonstrate that an improved conformational space discretization is achieved by incorporating the effective energy. The most distinctive feature of this thermodynamic order parameter is that it works in pointing to near-native folded structures even when the knowledge of the native structure is lacking, and the use of the effective energy will also find applications in combination with methods of protein structure prediction.","[Chong, Song-Ho; Ham, Sihyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341, 2017R1A2B3010053]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Nos NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341 and 2017R1A2B3010053).

Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (-106 M-is-1). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 has trajectories, identifies and quantifies multiple ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel -opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up multiple pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a single dominant pathway for ligand binding.","[Mondal, Jagannath; Ahalawat, Navjeet; Pandit, Subhendu; Vallurupalli, Pramodh] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kay, Lewis E.] Hosp Sick Children, Program Mol Med, Toronto, ON, Canada","Mondal, J; Vallurupalli, P (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",jmondal@tifrh.res.in; pramodh@tifrh.res.in,,"Ahalawat, Navjeet/0000-0002-9665-8709","Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad (TIFRH); Department of Science and Technology of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [ECR/2016/ 000672, ECR/2016/001088]; Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [TG-CHE150024]","This work was supported by startup funds from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad (TIFRH; JM and PV), early career research funds provided by Department of Science and Technology of India (ECR/2016/ 000672 to JM) and (ECR/2016/001088 to PV), and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE; TG-CHE150024 to JM).

After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome.

For a better understanding of their functions, knowledge of the mechanism by which they fold into the functional native structures is necessary. In this work, we studied the folding process of the thrombin-binding aptamer G-quadruplex. Enabled by a computational paradigm that couples an advanced sampling method and a Markov state model, four folding intermediates were identified, including an antiparallel G-hairpin, two G-triplex structures, and a double-hairpin conformation. Likewise, a misfolded structure with a nonnative distribution of syn/anti guanines was also observed. Based on these states, a transition path analysis revealed three fast-folding pathways, along which the thrombin-binding aptamer would fold to the native state directly, with no evidence of potential nonnative competing conformations. The results also showed that the TGT-loop plays an important role in the folding process. The findings of this research may provide general insight about the folding of other G-quadruplex structures.","[Bian, Yunqiang; Song, Feng; Yu, Jiafeng; Wang, Jihua] Dezhou Univ, Inst Biophys, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biophys, Dezhou, Peoples R China; [Cao, Zanxia; Zhao, Liling; Wang, Jihua] Dezhou Univ, Dept Phys, Dezhou, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinlu] Wuxi Vocat Inst Commerce, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinlu] Taihu Univ Wuxi, Wuxi, Peoples R China","Bian, YQ; Wang, JH (corresponding author), Dezhou Univ, Inst Biophys, Shandong Prov Key Lab Biophys, Dezhou, Peoples R China.; Wang, JH (corresponding author), Dezhou Univ, Dept Phys, Dezhou, Peoples R China.",bianyunqiang@gmail.com; jhw25336@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11504043, 31500606, 61671107, 31670727]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2015CQ002, ZR2016JL027]; Taishan Young Scholars Program of Shandong Province of China [tsqn20161049]; Technology Development Project of Shandong Province [2014GNC110025]; Natural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province [16KJB140014]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 11504043, 31500606, 61671107, and 31670727), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (grant numbers ZR2015CQ002, and ZR2016JL027), Taishan Young Scholars Program of Shandong Province of China (grant number tsqn20161049), Technology Development Project of Shandong Province (grant number: 2014GNC110025), and Natural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (grant number 16KJB140014).",,72,4,4,2,35,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms of nucleosome sliding by multiscale molecular simulations, characterizing how the screw-like motion of DNA proceeds via the formation and propagation of twist defects. Firstly, coarse-grained molecular simulations reveal that the sliding dynamics is highly dependent on DNA sequence. Depending on the sequence and the nucleosome super-helical location, we find two distinct types of twist defects: a locally under-twisted DNA region, previously observed in crystal structures, and a locally over-twisted DNA, an unprecedented feature. The stability of the over-twist defect was confirmed via all-atom simulations. Analysis of our trajectories via Markov state modeling highlights how the sequence-dependence of the sliding dynamics is due to the different twist defect energy costs, and in particular how nucleosome regions where defects cannot easily form introduce the kinetic bottlenecks slowing down repositioning. Twist defects can also mediate sliding of nucleosomes made with strong positioning sequences, albeit at a much lower diffusion coefficient, due to a high-energy intermediate state. Finally, we discuss how chromatin remodelers may exploit these spontaneous fluctuations to induce unidirectional sliding of nucleosomes.","[Brandani, Giovanni B.; Niina, Toru; Tan, Cheng; Takada, Shoji] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Kyoto 6068502, Japan","Takada, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biophys, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",takada@biophys.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tan, Cheng/AAE-5402-2019","Tan, Cheng/0000-0002-8957-4267","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25251019, 16KT0054, 16H01303]; MEXT as 'Priority Issue on Post-K computer'; RIKEN Pioneering Project 'Dynamical Structural Biology'; MEXT 'Priority Issue on Post-K computer'; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16KT0054, 16H01303] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI [25251019 to S.T., 16KT0054 to S.T., 16H01303 to S.T.]; MEXT as 'Priority Issue on Post-K computer' (to S.T.); RIKEN Pioneering Project 'Dynamical Structural Biology' (to S.T.).

Yet, it is still unclear whether membrane protein degradation requires transport back to the cell body or whether degradation also occurs locally at the axon terminal, where live observation of sorting and degradation has remained a challenge. Here, we report direct observation of two cargo-specific membrane protein degradation mechanisms at axon terminals based on a live-imaging approach in intact Drosophila brains. We show that different acidification-sensing cargo probes are sorted into distinct classes of degradative hub'' compartments for synaptic vesicle proteins and plasma membrane proteins at axon terminals. Sorting and degradation of the two cargoes in the separate hubs are molecularly distinct. Local sorting of synaptic vesicle proteins for degradation at the axon terminal is, surprisingly, Rab7 independent, whereas sorting of plasma membrane proteins is Rab7 dependent. The cathepsin-like protease CP1 is specific to synaptic vesicle hubs, and its delivery requires the vesicle SNARE neuronal synaptobrevin. Cargo separation only occurs at the axon terminal, whereas degradative compartments at the cell body are mixed. These data show that at least two local, molecularly distinct pathways sort membrane cargo for degradation specifically at the axon terminal, whereas degradation can occur both at the terminal and en route to the cell body.","[Jin, Eugene Jennifer; Kiral, Ferdi Ridvan; Ozel, Mehmet Neset; Burchardt, Lara Sophie; Epstein, Daniel; Wolfenberg, Heike; Hiesinger, Peter Robin] Free Univ Berlin, Div Neurobiol, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jin, Eugene Jennifer; Ozel, Mehmet Neset] UT Southwestern Med Ctr, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dallas, TX 75390 USA; [Osterland, Marc; Prohaska, Steffen] Zuse Inst Berlin, Takustr 7, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Epstein, Daniel] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Surg, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA","Hiesinger, PR (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Div Neurobiol, Konigin Luise Str 1-3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",robin.hiesinger@fu-berlin.de,"Burchardt, Lara Sophie/L-9563-2019","Burchardt, Lara Sophie/0000-0002-9210-7934; Kiral, Ferdi Ridvan/0000-0002-7006-9332; Ozel, Mehmet Neset/0000-0002-0185-5866","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB958, SFB/TRR186]; NeuroCure Cluster Berlin; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RO1EY018884, RO1EY023333, T32 NS069562, F31 NS084774]; Muscular Dystrophy Association of the USAMuscular Dystrophy Association; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB958]; NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Eye Institute (NEI) [R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY023333, R01EY023333, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY018884, R01EY023333, R01EY023333, R01EY023333, R01EY018884] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We would like to thank all members of the Hiesinger lab, Volker Haucke, Bettina Winckler, Mathias Wernet, Bassem Hassan, Ilya Bezprozvanny, Craig Garner, and Stephan Sigrist for helpful discussions.

We first demonstrate our method is able to describe the effects of force field changes in capped alanine dipeptide after learning about a model using AMBER99. We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation.

We describe a fast protocol called MELD-path that (1) efficiently samples relevant conformational states via MELD, an accelerator of Molecular Dynamics (MD), (2) seeds multiple short MD trajectories from MELD states, and then (3) constructs Markov State Models (MSM) that give the routes and kinetics. We tested the method against extensive (multi pis) MD simulations of the right-handed- to left-handed-helix transition of a 9-mer peptide of MB, the symmetry of which allows us to establish convergence. MELD-path finds all the metastable states, their correct relative populations, and the full ensemble of routes, not just a single assumed route. For this transition, we find a very broad route structure. MELD-path is highly parallelizable and efficient, yielding the full route map in a few days of computation.

It might be subject to time-varying forcing; or be in a transient phase on its way towards equilibrium; it might even be in equilibrium without us noticing it, due to insufficient observations; and it even might be a system failing to admit an equilibrium distribution at all. We review some of the approaches that model the effective statistical behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and show that both cases can be considered under the unified framework of optimal low-rank approximation of so-called transfer operators. Particular attention is given to the connection between these methods, Markov state models, and the concept of metastability, further to the estimation of such reduced order models from finite simulation data. All these topics bear an important role in, e.g., molecular dynamics, where Markov state models are often and successfully utilized, and which is the main motivating application in this paper.

We recently demonstrated that, for a heptapeptide of alanine residues, the structural and kinetic properties of a simulation model are linked in a rather simple way, given a certain level of physics present in the model. In this work, we extend these findings to a longer peptide, for which the representation of configuration space in terms of a full enumeration of sequences of helical/coil states along the peptide backbone is impractical. We verify the structural-kinetic relationships by scanning the parameter space of a simple native-biased model and then employ a distinct transferable model to validate and generalize the conclusions. Our results further demonstrate the validity of the previous findings, while clarifying the role of conformational entropy in the determination of the structural-kinetic relationships. More specifically, while the global, long timescale kinetic properties of a particular class of models with varying energetic parameters but approximately fixed conformational entropy are determined by the overarching structural features of the ensemble, a shift in these kinetic observables occurs for models with a distinct representation of steric interactions. At the same time, the relationship between structure and more local, faster kinetic properties is not affected by varying the conformational entropy of the model.","[Rudzinski, Joseph F.; Bereau, Tristan] Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","Rudzinski, JF (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Polymer Res, D-55128 Mainz, Germany.",rudzinski@mpip-mainz.mpg.de; bereau@mpip-mainz.mpg.de,"Bereau, Tristan/G-4987-2010; Rudzinski, Joseph F./AAR-7971-2020","Bereau, Tristan/0000-0001-9945-1271; Rudzinski, Joseph F./0000-0003-3403-640X",Alexander von Humboldt foundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG),We thank Marius Bause and Alessia Centi for critical reading of the manuscript.

We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for MSMs in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving MSM building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of MSM analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein-protein association.

In these systems, at the temperature used, the peptide can be folded or unfolded and bound or unbound to crowder molecules. Four or five major free-energy minima can be identified. To estimate the dominant MC relaxation times of the peptide, we build MSMs using a range of different time resolutions or lag times. We show that stable relaxation-time estimates can be obtained from the MSM eigenfunctions through fits to autocorrelation data. The eigenfunctions remain sufficiently accurate to permit stable relaxation-time estimation down to small lag times, at which point simple estimates based on the corresponding eigenvalues have large systematic uncertainties. The presence of the crowders has a stabilizing effect on the peptide, especially with BPTI crowders, which can be attributed to a reduced unfolding rate k(u), while the folding rate k(f) is left largely unchanged.

This problem is alleviated through constructing models with multiple collective variables, for which we employ the time-lagged independent component analysis requiring only minimal prior knowledge.

We here test and benchmark the common nearest neighbor (CNN) cluster algorithm. This algorithm assigns a spherical neighborhood R to each data point and estimates the data-point density between two data points as the number of data points N in the overlapping region of their neighborhoods (step 1). The main principle in the CNN cluster algorithm is cluster growing. This grows the clusters by sequentially adding data points and thereby effectively positions the border of the clusters along an iso-surface of the underlying probability density. This yields a strict partitioning with outliers, for which the cluster represents peaks in the underlying probability density-termed core sets (step 2). The removal of the outliers on the basis of a threshold criterion is optional (step 3). The benchmark datasets address a series of typical challenges, including datasets with a very high dimensional state space and datasets in which the cluster centroids are aligned along an underlying structure (Birch sets). The performance of the CNN algorithm is evaluated with respect to these challenges. The results indicate that the CNN cluster algorithm can be useful in a wide range of settings. Cluster algorithms are particularly important for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We demonstrate how the CNN cluster results can be used as a discretization of the molecular state space for the construction of a core-set model of the MD improving the accuracy compared to conventional full-partitioning models. The software for the CNN clustering is available on GitHub.","[Lemke, Oliver; Keller, Bettina G.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol, Chem, Pharm, Takustr 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Keller, BG (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol, Chem, Pharm, Takustr 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",oliver.lemke@fu-berlin.de; bettina.keller@fu-berlin.de,"Keller, Bettina G./B-7834-2011","Keller, Bettina G./0000-0002-7051-0888",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC765],"This research has been funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through CRC765 Multivalency as chemical organization and action principle: New architectures, functions and applications, Project C10.",,60,5,5,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1999-4893,,,ALGORITHMS,Algorithms,FEB,2018,11,2,,,,,,,19,10.3390/a11020019,,,21,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Computer Science,FZ3QG,WOS:000427504200008,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-11-19,

The coarse graining of MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for the coarse-graining of MSMs into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.","[Husic, Brooke E.; McKiernan, Keri A.; Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.; Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,"Husic, Brooke/0000-0002-8020-3750",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH R01-GM62868]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowhip Program,We acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH R01-GM62868).

Conventional numerical techniques for data-driven computation of invariant measures rely on estimation and further numerical processing of a transition matrix. Here we show how the quality of data-driven estimation of a transition matrix crucially depends on the validity of the statistical independence assumption for transition probabilities. Moreover, the cost of the invariant measure computation in general scales cubically with the dimension - and is usually unfeasible for realistic high-dimensional systems. We introduce a method relaxing the independence assumption of transition probabilities that scales quadratically in situations with latent variables. Applications of the method are illustrated on the Lorenz-63 system and for the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data of the alpha-synuclein protein. We demonstrate how the conventional methodologies do not provide good estimates of the invariant measure based upon the available alpha-synuclein MD data.

This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets.

However, due to the low resolution of SAXS data, high-resolution data obtained from X-ray crystallography or NMR and computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are complementary to SAXS data for understanding protein functions based on their structures at atomic resolution. Because MD simulations provide a physicochemically proper structural ensemble for flexible proteins in solution and a precise description of solvent effects, the hybrid analysis of SAXS and MD simulations is a promising method to estimate reasonable solution structures and structural ensembles in solution. Here, we review typical and useful in silico methods for modeling three dimensional protein structures, calculating theoretical SAXS profiles, and analyzing ensemble structures consistent with experimental SAXS profiles. We also review two examples of the hybrid analysis, termed MD-SAXS method in which MD simulations are carried out without any knowledge of experimental SAXS data, and the experimental SAXS data are used only to assess the consistency of the solution model from MD simulations with those observed in experiments. One example is an investigation of the intrinsic dynamics of EcoO109I using the computational method to obtain a theoretical profile from the trajectory of an MD simulation. The other example is a structural investigation of the vitamin D receptor ligand-binding domain using snapshots generated by MD simulations and assessment of the snapshots by experimental SAXS data.","[Ekimoto, Toru; Ikeguchi, Mitsunori] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ikeguchi, Mitsunori] RIKEN, Med Sci Innovat Hub Program, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Ikeguchi, M (corresponding author), Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.; Ikeguchi, M (corresponding author), RIKEN, Med Sci Innovat Hub Program, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",ekimoto@yokohama-cu.ac.jp; ike@yokohama-cu.ac.jp,,,,,,82,4,4,1,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0065-2598,2214-8019,978-981-13-2200-6; 978-981-13-2199-3,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2018,1105,,,,,,237,258,,10.1007/978-981-13-2200-6_15,10.1007/978-981-13-2200-6,,22,"Biology; Biophysics; Medicine, Research & Experimental",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Biophysics; Research & Experimental Medicine,BL9QC,WOS:000458020900015,30617833,,,,2020-11-19,

Yet, MD simulations are limited due to the availability of high-resolution protein structures, accuracy of the underlying force-field, computational expense, and difficulty in analysing big data-sets. Machine learning algorithms are now routinely used to circumvent many of these limitations and computational biophysicists are continuously making progress in developing novel applications. Here, we discuss some of these methods, varying from traditional dimensionality reduction approaches to more recent abstractions such as transfer learning and reinforcement learning, and how they have been used to deal with the challenges in MD. We conclude with the prospective issues in the application of machine learning methods in MD, to increase accuracy and efficiency of protein dynamics studies in general.","[Mittal, Shriyaa; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,"Mittal, Shriyaa/I-8121-2019","Mittal, Shriyaa/0000-0003-3490-1969; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","New Innovator award from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [C2185]; Computational Science and Engineering Fellows Program at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL","DS acknowledges support from the New Innovator award from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research [C2185].

Here we present the structure of the full-length rabbit TRPV5 channel as determined using cryo-EM in complex with its inhibitor econazole. This structure reveals that econazole resides in a hydrophobic pocket analogous to that occupied by phosphatidylinositides and vanilloids in TRPV1, thus suggesting conserved mechanisms for ligand recognition and lipid binding among TRPV channels. The econazole-bound TRPV5 structure adopts a closed conformation with a distinct lower gate that occludes Ca2+ permeation through the channel. Structural comparisons between TRPV5 and other TRPV channels, complemented with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the econazole-bound TRPV5 structure, allowed us to gain mechanistic insight into TRPV5 channel inhibition by small molecules.","[Hughes, Taylor E.

We address especially the following questions: How to choose a computational approach suited to a particular problem? What are the strengths and limitations of alternative approaches? What is the current accuracy of thermodynamic and kinetic predictions? What are today's open challenges and promising development directions?

If these CVs are coincident with the slow collective modes governing the long-time dynamical evolution, then they also furnish good coordinates in which to perform enhanced sampling to surmount high free energy barriers and efficiently explore and recover the landscape. Non-linear manifold learning techniques provide a means to systematically extract such CVs from molecular simulation trajectories by identifying and extracting low-dimensional manifolds lying latent within the high-dimensional coordinate space. We survey recent advances in data-driven CV discovery and enhanced sampling using non-linear manifold learning, describe the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of these techniques, and present illustrative examples to molecular folding and colloidal self-assembly.

SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu(2.65) in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E-2.65 A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu(2.65) and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E-2.65 A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of similar to 77 mu s of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E-2.65 A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu(2.65). Our results also indicate that the E-2.65 A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu(2.65) in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.","[Verma, Ravi Kumar; Abramyan, Ara M.; Michino, Mayako; Shi, Lei] NIDA, Computat Chem & Mol Biophys Unit, Mol Targets & Medicat Discovery Branch, Intramural Res Program,NIH, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Free, R.

There is strong evidence suggesting that structural changes occurring in large biomolecular systems at long time scale dynamics may be captured by models coarser than atomistic, although a suitable or optimal coarse-graining is a priori unknown. Here we propose a systematic approach to learning a coarse representation of a macromolecule from microscopic simulation data. In particular, the definition of effective coarse variables is achieved by partitioning the degrees of freedom both in the structural (physical) space and in the conformational space. The identification of groups of microscopic particles forming dynamical coherent states in different metastable states leads to a multiscale description of the system, in space and time. The application of this approach to the folding dynamics of two proteins provides a revised view of the classical idea of prestructured regions (foldons) that combine during a protein-folding process and suggests a hierarchical characterization of the assembly process of folded structures.","[Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Banisch, Ralf; Clementi, Cecilia] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",cecilia@rice.edu,,"Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC1114]; Big Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Freie Universitat, Berlin; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1265929] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, and PHY-1427654), the Welch Foundation (C-1570), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through CRC1114 (Project B03).

Investigating these functional conformational changes is therefore essential for understanding the corresponding biological processes and promoting bioengineering applications and rational drug design. Constructing Markov State Models (MSMs) based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations has emerged as a powerful approach to model functional conformational changes of the biomolecular system with sufficient resolution in both time and space. However, the rapid development of theory and algorithms for constructing MSMs has made it difficult for nonexperts to understand and apply the MSM framework, necessitating a comprehensive guidance toward its theory and practical usage. In this study, we introduce the MSM theory of conformational dynamics based on the projection operator scheme. We further propose a general protocol of constructing MSM to investigate functional conformational changes, which integrates the state-of-the-art techniques for building and optimizing initial pathways, performing adaptive sampling and constructing MSMs. We anticipate this protocol to be widely applied and useful in guiding nonexperts to study the functional conformational changes of large biomolecular systems via the MSM framework. We also discuss the current limitations of MSMs and some alternative methods to alleviate them.

Interestingly, the sequence of ApoE4 differs from its wild-type ApoE3 by a single amino acid C112R in the 299-amino-acid-long sequence. Hence, the puzzle remains: how a single-amino-acid difference between the ApoE3 and ApoE4 sequences can give rise to structural dissimilarities between the two isoforms, which can potentially lead to functional differences with significant pathological consequences. The major obstacle in addressing this question has been the lack of a 3D atomistic structure of ApoE4 to date. In this work, we resolve the issue by computationally modeling a plausible atomistic 3D structure of ApoE4. Our microsecond-long atomistic simulations elucidate key structural differences between monomeric ApoE3 and ApoE4, which renders ApoE4 thermodynamically less stable, less structured, and topologically less rigid compared to ApoE3. Consistent with an experimental report of the molten globule state of ApoE4, simulations identify multiple partially folded intermediates for ApoE4, which are implicated in the stronger aggregation propensity of ApoE4.","[Ray, Angana; Ahalawat, Navjeet; Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Hyderabad, Telangana, India","Mondal, J (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.",jmondal@tifrh.res.in,,"Ahalawat, Navjeet/0000-0002-9665-8709; Ray, Angana/0000-0002-5785-9188",Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) [PDF/2016/002712]; Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchTata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Department of Science and Technology (DST) Science and Engineering Research Board [ECR/2016/000672]; Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad (CIS/TIFR-H),"This work was supported by startup funds for the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad (CIS/TIFR-H) (to J.M.), with early career research funds provided by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) Science and Engineering Research Board (ECR/2016/000672) (to J.M.).

Tuning these populations of conformational states through mutation enables evolution toward additional activities. Here we computationally evaluate the population shifts induced by distal and active site mutations in a family of computationally designed and experimentally optimized retro-aldolases. The conformational landscape of these enzymes was significantly altered during evolution, as preexisting catalytically active conformational substates became major states in the most evolved variants. We further demonstrate that key residues responsible for these substate conversions can be predicted computationally. Significantly, the identified residues coincide with those positions mutated in the laboratory evolution experiments. This study establishes that distal mutations that affect enzyme catalytic activity can be predicted computationally and thus provides the enzyme (re)design field with a rational strategy to determine promising sites for enhancing activity through mutation.","[Romero-Rivera, Adrian; Garcia-Borras, Marc; Osuna, Silvia] Univ Girona, IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain; [Romero-Rivera, Adrian; Garcia-Borras, Marc; Osuna, Silvia] Univ Girona, Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain; [Garcia-Borras, Marc] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, 607 Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Garcia-Borras, M; Osuna, S (corresponding author), Univ Girona, IQCC, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain.; Garcia-Borras, M; Osuna, S (corresponding author), Univ Girona, Dept Quim, Carrer Maria Aurelia Capmany 69, Girona 17003, Spain.; Garcia-Borras, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, 607 Charles E Young Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",marcgbq@gmail.com; silvia.osuna@udg.edu,"Garcia-Borras, Marc/K-7996-2012; Garcia-Borras, Marc/H-7055-2019","Garcia-Borras, Marc/0000-0001-9458-1114; Garcia-Borras, Marc/0000-0001-9458-1114; Osuna, Silvia/0000-0003-3657-6469","Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de Catalunya [2015-FI-B-00165]; Ramon Areces Foundation; Spanish MINECO [CTQ2014-52525-P, CTQ2014-59212-P]; Ramon y Cajal contractSpanish Government [RYC-2014-16846]; European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [PCIG14-GA-2013-630978]; European Research Council (ERC) under European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2015-StG-679001]","A.R-R. thanks the Generalitat de Catalunya for a Ph.D. fellowship (2015-FI-B-00165), M.G.-B. is grateful to the Ramon Areces Foundation for a postdoctoral fellowship and the Spanish MINECO for project CTQ2014-52525-P.

The proposed method requires only a small number of initial microstates because it corrects for errors produced by limited sampling. Whereas many methods rely on fuzzy partitions for proper statistics, GRAD retains a crisp decomposition.

Unfortunately, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations cannot directly sample the excessively long residence and rearrangement times of tightly binding complexes. Here we exploit the recently developed multi-ensemble Markov model framework to compute full protein-peptide kinetics of the oncoprotein fragment (25-109)Mdm2 and the nano-molar inhibitor peptide PMI. Using this system, we report, for the first time, direct estimates of kinetics beyond the seconds timescale using simulations of an all-atom MD model, with high accuracy and precision. These results only require explicit simulations on the sub-milliseconds timescale and are tested against existing mutagenesis data and our own experimental measurements of the dissociation and association rates. The full kinetic model reveals an overall downhill but rugged binding funnel with multiple pathways. The overall strong binding arises from a variety of conformations with different hydrophobic contact surfaces that interconvert on the milliseconds timescale.","[Paul, Fabian; Wehmeyer, Christoph; Abualrous, Esam T.; Wu, Hao; Schoneberg, Johannes; Noe, Frank] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Paul, Fabian; Wehmeyer, Christoph; Abualrous, Esam T.; Wu, Hao; Schoneberg, Johannes; Noe, Frank] Univ Calif Berkeley, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Paul, Fabian; Weikl, Thomas R.] Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Theory & Bio Syst, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Crabtree, Michael D.; Clarke, Jane] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Freund, Christian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, Thielallee 63, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Noe, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Noe, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Calif Inst Quantitat Biosci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Abualrous, Esam T/E-1698-2018; Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Weikl, Thomas R/G-8572-2016","Abualrous, Esam T/0000-0001-9582-9089; Weikl, Thomas R/0000-0002-0911-5328; Wehmeyer, Christoph/0000-0002-9526-0328; Schoneberg, Johannes/0000-0001-7083-1828; Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324; Crabtree, Michael/0000-0003-1466-4011","European Commission (ERC StG); Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 1114/C3, SFB 740/D7, TRR 186/A12, SFB 1114/A4]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [1348064] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank Matt Harvey (Acellera Ltd.) and Markus Rampp and Ingeborg Weidl (Max Planck Computing and Data Facility) for technical support and the Max Planck Society for usage of the Hydra supercomputer.

At low NAA concentrations, sigmoidal shape of kinetic curve is observed, followed by typical rate growth of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, whereas at high NAA concentrations self-inhibition takes place. We show that this rate dependence is consistent with a moleular model, in which N-acetylaspartate appears to have three faces in the enzyme reaction, acting as activator at low concentrations, substrate at moderate concentrations, and inhibitor at high concentrations. To support thiS conclusion we identify binding sites of NAA at the hAsp dimer including those on the protein surface (activating sites) and at the dimer interface (inhibiting site). Using the Markov state model approach we demonstrate that population of either activating or inhibiting site shifts the equilibrium between the hAsp dieter conformations with the open and closed gates leading to the enzyme active site buried inside the protein. These conclusions are in accord with the calculated values of binding constants of NAA at the hAsp dimer, indicating that the activating site with a higher affinity to NAA should be occupied first, whereas the inhibiting site with a lower affinity to NAA should be occupied later. Application of the dynamical network analysis shows that communication pathways between the regulatory sites (activating or inhibiting) and the gates to the active site do not interfere. These considerations allow us to develop a kinetic mechanism and to derive the equation for the reaction rate covering the entire NAA concentration range. Perfect agreement between theoretical and experimental kinetic data provides strong support to the proposed catalytic model.","[Khrenova, Maria G.; Kots, Ekaterina D.; Varfolomeev, Sergey D.; Nemukhin, Alexander V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Kots, Ekaterina D.; Varfolomeev, Sergey D.; Lushchekina, Sofya V.; Nemukhin, Alexander V.] Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, Moscow 119991, Russia","Nemukhin, AV (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia.; Nemukhin, AV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, Moscow 119991, Russia.",anemukhin@yahoo.com,"Khrenova, Maria G/I-4829-2014; Lushchekina, Sofya/F-8469-2010; Varfolomeev, Sergei D./L-7499-2018","Khrenova, Maria G/0000-0001-7117-3089; Lushchekina, Sofya/0000-0002-6922-020X; Nemukhin, Alexander/0000-0002-4992-6029",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-13-00124],This study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project # 14-13-00124).

To gain molecular understanding on these novel polymeric species, we have constructed force-field parameters and simulated the behaviors of polymers with and without phenylalanine grafted as side chains under conditions compatible with different pHs. The free energy changes upon polymer permeation through membrane were calculated using the umbrella sampling technique. We show that both polymers with and without grafts interact better with the membrane under conditions compatible with lower pH. The conformational states of the polymers were investigated in water and at a water-membrane interface. On the basis of Markov state modeling results, we propose a possible advantage of the grafted polymer over the ungrafted polymer for membrane rupture because of its quicker conformational rearrangement kinetics.","[Wang, Shuzhe; Bresme, Fernando] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England","Bresme, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem, London SW7 2AZ, England.",fbresme@imperial.ac.uk,"Bresme, Fernando/A-9542-2009; Wang, Shuzhe/AAH-4060-2020","Wang, Shuzhe/0000-0001-7543-7387","EPSRC-UKEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J003859/1, EP/J017566/1]; EU 7th Framework Programme ITN-SNAL; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J017566/1, EP/J003859/1] Funding Source: researchfish","The authors thank Dr. Rongjun Chen for insightful discussions.

However, a microscopic model describing the structures and kinetics during association and dissociation is lacking on account of the long lifetimes of associated states, which have prevented efficient sampling by direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Here we demonstrate protein-protein association and dissociation in atomistic resolution for the ribonuclease barnase and its inhibitor barstar by combining adaptive high-throughput MD simulations and hidden Markov modelling. The model reveals experimentally consistent intermediate structures, energetics and kinetics on timescales from microseconds to hours. A variety of flexibly attached intermediates and misbound states funnel down to a transition state and a native basin consisting of the loosely bound near-native state and the tightly bound crystallographic state.

Depending upon the binding of sodium ions, thrombin presents significantly different enzymatic activities. In the environment with sodium ions, thrombin is highly active in cleaving the coagulated substrates and this is referred to as the fast'' form; in the environment without sodium ions, thrombin turns catalytically less active and is in the slow'' form. Although many experimental studies over the last two decades have attempted to reveal the structural and kinetic differences between these two forms, it remains vague and disputed how the functional switch between the fast'' and slow'' forms is mediated by Na+ cations. In this work, we employ microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the differences in the structural ensembles in sodium-bound/unbound and potassium-bound/unbound thrombin. Our calculations indicate that the regulatory regions, including the 60s, g loops, and exosite I and II, are primarily affected by both the bound and unbound cations. Conformational free energy surfaces, estimated from principal component analysis, further reveal the existence of multiple conformational states. The binding of a cation introduces changes in the distribution of these states. Through comparisons with potassium-binding, the binding of sodium ions appears to shift the population toward conformational states that might be catalytically favorable. Our study of thrombin in the presence of sodium/potassium ions suggests Na+-mediated generalized allostery is the mechanism of thrombin's functional switch between the fast'' and slow'' forms.","[Xiao, Jiajie; Melvin, Ryan L.; Salsbury, Freddie R., Jr.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Phys, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Xiao, Jiajie] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27109

To shed light on the dynamic and kinetic elements underlying MOR functional selectivity, we carried out close to half millisecond high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations of MOR bound to a classical opioid drug (morphine) or a potent G protein-biased agonist (TRV-130). Statistical analyses of Markov state models built using this large simulation dataset combined with information theory enabled, for the first time: a) Identification of four distinct metastable regions along the activation pathway, b) Kinetic evidence of a different dynamic behavior of the receptor bound to a classical or G protein-biased opioid agonist, c) Identification of kinetically distinct conformational states to be used for the rational design of functionally selective ligands that may eventually be developed into improved drugs; d) Characterization of multiple activation/deactivation pathways of MOR, and e) Suggestion from calculated transition timescales that MOR conformational changes are not the rate-limiting step in receptor activation.","[Kapoor, Abhijeet; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Martinez-Rosell, Gerard; de Fabritiis, Gianni] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Computat Biophys Lab GRIB IMIM, Barcelona Biomed Res Pk PRBB, C Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [de Fabritiis, Gianni] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Filizola, M (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA.; de Fabritiis, G (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Computat Biophys Lab GRIB IMIM, Barcelona Biomed Res Pk PRBB, C Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain.; de Fabritiis, G (corresponding author), ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain.",gianni.defabritiis@upf.edu; marta.filizola@mssm.edu,"Kapoor, Abhijeet/V-3284-2019","Kapoor, Abhijeet/0000-0002-3606-3463","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA026434, DA034049, MH107053]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [675451]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1053575]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH107053, R21MH107053] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [R01DA034049, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD018522] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants DA026434, DA034049, and MH107053(to M.F.) and by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 675451 (CompBio Med project; to G.D.F).

Here, we use a spectrum of computational modeling and simulation approaches to obtain the underlying molecular mechanism in atomistic detail. Interestingly, our quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that a benztropine derivative JHWOO7 prefers a different stereoisomeric conformation of tropane in binding to DAT compared to that of a cocaine derivative, CFT. To further investigate the different inhibition mechanisms of DAT, we carried out MD simulations in combination with Markov state modeling analysis of wild-type and Y156F DAT in the absence of any ligand or the presence of CFT or JHW007. Our results indicate that the Y156F mutation and CFT shift the conformational equilibrium toward an outward-open conformation, whereas JHWOO7 prefers an inward-occluded conformation. Our findings reveal the mechanistic details of DAT inhibition by JHW007 at the atomistic level, which provide clues for rational design of atypical inhibitors.","[Abramyan, Ara M.; Shi, Lei] NIDA, Computat Chem & Mol Biophys Unit, Mol Targets & Medicat Discovery Branch, NIH,IRP, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Stolzenberg, Sebastian; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Computat Mol Biol Grp, Inst Math, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Li, Zheng; Shi, Lei] Cornell Univ, Weill Cornell Med Coll, Dept Physiol & Biophys, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Loland, Claus J.] Univ Copenhagen, Mol Neuropharmacol Grp, Dept Neurosci & Pharmacol, Fac Hlth Sci,Panum Inst, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark","Shi, L (corresponding author), 333 Cassell Dr,Room 1121, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA.",lei.shi2@nih.gov,"Shi, Lei/AAV-1321-2020; Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Shi, Lei/0000-0002-4137-096X; ","Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse; Freie Universitat Berlin; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606, ZIADA000606] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Support for this research was provided to A.M.A. and L.S. by the Intramural Research Program of National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The free energy surfaces underlying these processes can be obtained from simulations using enhanced sampling methods. However, their altered dynamics makes kinetic and mechanistic information difficult or impossible to extract. Here, we show that, with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics are captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate, coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperature. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the procedure by constructing master equation (Markov state) models of peptide and RNA folding from REMD simulations.","[Stelzl, Lukas S.; Hummer, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hummer, Gerhard] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Hummer, G (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.; Hummer, G (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",gerhard.hummer@biophys.mpg.de,"Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013","Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X; Stelzl, Lukas/0000-0002-5348-0277",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC902]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society,"We acknowledge financial support from the German Research Foundation (CRC902: Molecular Principles of RNA Based Regulation) and by the Max Planck Society.

Markov models have emerged as a powerful way to approximate the molecular kinetics of large biomolecules while keeping full structural resolution in a divide-and-conquer fashion. However, the accuracy of these models is limited by that of the force fields used to generate the underlying molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Whereas the quality of classical MD force fields has improved significantly in recent years, remaining errors in the Boltzmann weights are still on the order of a few kT, which may lead to significant discrepancies when comparing to experimentally measured rates or state populations. Here we take the view that simulations using a sufficiently good force-field sample conformations that are valid but have inaccurate weights, yet these weights may be made accurate by incorporating experimental data a posteriori. To do so, we propose augmented Markov models (AMMs), an approach that combines concepts from probability theory and information theory to consistently treat systematic force-field error and statistical errors in simulation and experiment. Our results demonstrate that AMMs can reconcile conflicting results for protein mechanisms obtained by different force fields and correct for a wide range of stationary and dynamical observables even when only equilibrium measurements are incorporated into the estimation process. This approach constitutes a unique avenue to combine experiment and computation into integrative models of biomolecular structure and dynamics.","[Olsson, Simon; Wu, Hao; Paul, Fabian; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Olsson, S; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",simon.olsson@fu-berlin.de; frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019","Olsson, Simon/0000-0002-3927-7897","Freie Universitat Berlin; European Commission (Dahlem Research School POINT-Marie Curie COFUND); European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC); Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [825/2-2, SFB 1114/A4, SFB 1114/C3]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Division Of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1265929] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank D.

We used different AMBER DNA force-field variants and also processed simulations by Markov State Model (MSM) analysis. The slow conformational transitions in the propeller loops took place on a scale of a few,us, emphasizing the need for long simulations in studies of GQ dynamics. The propeller loops sampled similar ensembles for all GQtopologies and for all force field dihedral-potential variants. The outcomes of standard and RECT simulations were consistent and captured similar spectrum of loop conformations. However, the most common crystallographic loop conformation was very unstable with all force-field versions. Although the loss of canonical gamma-trans state of the first propeller loop nucleotide could be related to the indispensable bsc0 alpha/gamma dihedral potential, even supporting this particular dihedral by a bias was insufficient to populate the experimentally dominant loop conformation. In conclusion, while our simulations were capable of providing a reasonable albeit not converged sampling of the TTA propeller loop conformational space, the force-field description still remained far from satisfactory.","[Islam, Barira; Stadlbauer, Petr; Otyepka, Michal; Sponer, Jiri] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Biophys, Kralovopolska 135, CS-61265 Brno, Czech Republic; [Stadlbauer, Petr; Banas, Pavel; Otyepka, Michal; Sponer, Jiri] Palacky Univ, Dept Phys Chem, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Fac Sci, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Gil-Ley, Alejandro; Bussi, Giovanni] Scuola Int Super Avanzati, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Perez-Hernandez, Guillermo] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Haider, Shozeb; Neidle, Stephen] UCL Sch Pharm, 29-39 Brunswick Sq, London WC1N 1AX, England; [Gil-Ley, Alejandro] Univ Iowa, Dept Mol Physiol & Biophys, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Sponer, J (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Biophys, Kralovopolska 135, CS-61265 Brno, Czech Republic.; Sponer, J (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Dept Phys Chem, Reg Ctr Adv Technol & Mat, Fac Sci, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",sponer@ncbr.muni.cz,"Otyepka, Michal/D-1220-2017; Gil-Ley, Alejandro/J-5851-2012; Sponer, Jiri/D-9467-2012; Bussi, Giovanni/A-1776-2009; Haider, Shozeb/B-3452-2015","Otyepka, Michal/0000-0002-1066-5677; Gil-Ley, Alejandro/0000-0002-0696-1609; Bussi, Giovanni/0000-0001-9216-5782; Haider, Shozeb/0000-0003-2650-2925; Perez-Hernandez, Guillermo/0000-0002-9287-8704; Sponer, Jiri/0000-0001-6558-6186","Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-13721S]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LO1305]; Praemium AcademiaeCzech Academy of Sciences; programme Projects of Large Research, Development, and Innovations Infrastructures [CESNET LM2015042]; European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP)/ERC GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [306662]; UCL excellence fellowship","This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation grant 16-13721S.

Understanding the molecular basis of misfolding and aggregation of prion proteins will be valuable for unveiling the etiology of prion diseases. However, due to the limitation of conventional experimental techniques and the heterogeneous property of oligomers, little is known about the molecular architecture of misfolded PrPSc and the mechanism of structural transition from PrPC to PrPSc. The prion fragment 127-147 (PrP127-147) has been reported to be a critical region for PrPSc formation in Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome and thus has been used as a model for the study of prion aggregation. In the present study, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques to study the conformational change of this fragment that could be relevant to the PrPC-PrPSc transition. Employing extensive replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) and conventional MD simulations, we sample a huge number of conformations of PrP127-147. Using the Markov state model (MSM), we identify the metastable conformational states of this fragment and the kinetic network of transitions between the states. The resulting MSM reveals that disordered random-coiled conformations are the dominant structures. A key metastable folded state with typical extended beta-sheet structures is identified with Pro137 being located in a turn region, consistent with a previous experimental report. Conformational analysis reveals that intrapeptide hydrophobic interaction and two key residue interactions, including Arg136-His140 and Pro137-His140, contribute a lot to the formation of ordered extended beta-sheet states. However, network pathway analysis from the most populated disordered state indicates that the formation of extended beta-sheet states is quite slow (at the millisecond level), as large structural rearrangement is needed from disordered states. We speculate that the formation process of the extended beta-sheet folded states may represent an important event during the early formation of prion oligomers and the results of our study provide insights into the molecular details of the early stage of prion aggregation.","[Zhou, Shuangyan; Liu, Huanxiang] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qianqian; Wang, Yuwei; Yao, Xiaojun] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Appl Organ Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun] Lanzhou Univ, Dept Chem, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Han, Wei] Beijing Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Key Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Liu, HX (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Pharm, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.; Han, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Key Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",hanw@pkusz.edu.cn; hxliu@lzu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Huanxiang/0000-0002-9284-3667","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21675070, 21673013]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2016-146]; Shenzhen STIC [JCYJ20160330095839867, KQTD2015032709315529]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21675070 to H.

In contrast to the availability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ folding. Scope of review: We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We explain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to study unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss the potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in the folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally different from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best described by a kinetic partitioning (10) mechanism. KP is a competition between at least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different conformational ensembles. Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain experiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of long-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the free energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences to populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme complexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of the folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective variables. General significance: We reconcile available computational and experimental studies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding landscapes.

Attempts to engineer peptides with improved recognition efficacy require thorough structural and thermodynamic characterization of the binding-competent conformations. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) approaches alone do not provide a thorough assessment of a peptide's recognition efficacy. In this study, in-solution binding properties of four different peptides, a hexamer (SNLHPK), an octamer (CSIVEDGK), NFO4 (VYMNRKYYKCCK), and a 13-mer (GPAGIDGPAGIRC), which were previously generated for OTA-specific recognition, were evaluated using an advanced MD simulation approach involving accelerated configurational search and predictive modeling. Peptide configurations relevant to ochratoxin binding were initially generated using biased exchange metadynamics and the dynamic properties associated with the in-solution peptide-ochratoxin binding were derived from Markov State Models. Among the various peptides, NFO4 shows superior in-solution OTA sensing and also shows superior selectivity for OTA vs. OTB due to the lower penalty associated with solvating its bound complex. Advanced MD approaches provide structural and energetic insights critical to the hapten-specific recognition to aid the engineering of peptides with better sensing efficacies.","[Thyparambil, Aby A.; Guiseppi-Elie, Anthony] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Engn, C3B, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Thyparambil, Aby A.; Guiseppi-Elie, Anthony] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Dwight Look Coll Engn, 5045 ETB, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Bazin, Ingrid] Ecole Mines Ales, Inst Mines, Telecom, 6 Ave Clavieres, F-30319 Ales, France; [Guiseppi-Elie, Anthony] ABTECH Sci Inc, Biotechnol Res Pk,800 East Leigh St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA","Guiseppi-Elie, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Engn, C3B, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.; Guiseppi-Elie, A (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Dwight Look Coll Engn, 5045 ETB, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.; Guiseppi-Elie, A (corresponding author), ABTECH Sci Inc, Biotechnol Res Pk,800 East Leigh St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",athypar@tamu.edu; ingrid.bazin@mines-ales.fr; guiseppi@tamu.edu,,,,,,46,4,4,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-6651,,,TOXINS,Toxins,MAY,2017,9,5,,,,,,,164,10.3390/toxins9050164,,,20,Food Science & Technology; Toxicology,Food Science & Technology; Toxicology,EY7AT,WOS:000404139000016,28505090,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced, the variational approach conformation dynamics/molecular kinetics (VAC) and its special case the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to approximate slow collective variables and molecular kinetics by linear combinations of smooth basis functions or order parameters. While it is known how to estimate MSMs from trajectories whose starting points are not sampled from an equilibrium ensemble, this has not yet been the case for TICA and the VAC. Previous estimates from short trajectories have been strongly biased and thus not variationally optimal. Here, we employ the Koopman operator theory and the ideas from dynamic mode decomposition to extend the VAC and TICA to non-equilibrium data. The main insight is that the VAC and TICA provide a coefficient matrix that we call Koopman model, as it approximates the underlying dynamical (Koopman) operator in conjunction with the basis set used. This Koopman model can be used to compute a stationary vector to reweight the data to equilibrium. From such a Koopman-reweighted sample, equilibrium expectation values and variationally optimal reversible Koopman models can be constructed even with short simulations. The Koopman model can be used to propagate densities, and its eigenvalue decomposition provides estimates of relaxation time scales and slow collective variables for dimension reduction. Koopman models are generalizations of Markov state models, TICA, and the linear VAC and allow molecular kinetics to be described without a cluster discretization.

Prior to presentation, peptides need to be generated from proteins that are either produced by the cell's own translational machinery or that are funneled into the endo-lysosomal vesicular system. The prolonged interaction between a T cell receptor and specific pMHC complexes, after an extensive search process in secondary lymphatic organs, eventually triggers T cells to proliferate and to mount a specific cellular immune response. Once processed, the peptide repertoire presented by MHC proteins largely depends on structural features of the binding groove of each particular MHC allelic variant. Additionally, two peptide editors-tapasin for class I and HLA-DM for class II-contribute to the shaping of the presented peptidome by favoring the binding of high-affinity antigens. Although there is a vast amount of biochemical and structural information, the mechanism of the catalyzed peptide exchange for MHC class I and class II proteins still remains controversial, and it is not well understood why certain MHC allelic variants are more susceptible to peptide editing than others. Recent studies predict a high impact of protein intermediate states on MHC allele-specific peptide presentation, which implies a profound influence of MHC dynamics on the phenomenon of immunodominance and the development of autoimmune diseases. Here, we review the recent literature that describe MHC class I and II dynamics from a theoretical and experimental point of view and we highlight the similarities between MHC class I and class II dynamics despite the distinct functions they fulfill in adaptive immunity.","[Wieczorek, Marek; Sticht, Jana; Alvaro-Benito, Miguel; Freund, Christian] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biochem, Prot Biochem, Berlin, Germany; [Abualrous, Esam T.; Stolzenberg, Sebastian; Noe, Frank] Inst Math, Computat Mol Biol Grp, Berlin, Germany","Freund, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biochem, Prot Biochem, Berlin, Germany.",christian.freund@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Abualrous, Esam T/E-1698-2018","Abualrous, Esam T/0000-0001-9582-9089; Alvaro-Benito, Miguel/0000-0002-6019-3567","DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB958, SFB854, TR186, SPP1623]","CF is thankful for funding by the DFG (SFB958, SFB854, TR186 and SPP1623).",,137,129,135,5,39,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-3224,,,FRONT IMMUNOL,Front.

In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these short simulations are in local equilibrium within the MSM states. However, over the last 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of MSMs from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model (OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate the exact eigenvalues or relaxation time scales of the system without estimating an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration. The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA of version 2.3.

Quantitative models that can link molecular-level knowledge of gene regulation to a global understanding of network dynamics have the potential to guide cell-reprogramming strategies. Networks are often modeled by the stochastic Chemical Master Equation, but methods for systematic identification of key properties of the global dynamics are currently lacking. Results: The method identifies the number, phenotypes, and lifetimes of long-lived states for a set of common gene regulatory network models. Application of transition path theory to the constructed Markov State Model decomposes global dynamics into a set of dominant transition paths and associated relative probabilities for stochastic state-switching. Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, we found that the Markov State Model provides a general framework for analyzing and visualizing stochastic multistability and state-transitions in gene networks. Our results suggest that this framework-adopted from the field of atomistic Molecular Dynamics-can be a useful tool for quantitative Systems Biology at the network scale.","[Chu, Brian K.; Tse, Margaret J.; Sato, Royce R.; Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Read, Elizabeth L.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA","Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.; Read, EL (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",elread@uci.edu,,"Read, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9186-284X",UC Irvine Henry Samueli School of Engineering,We acknowledge financial support from the UC Irvine Henry Samueli School of Engineering.,,89,10,10,1,12,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1752-0509,,,BMC SYST BIOL,BMC Syst.

When these states have distinct chemical shifts, the measurement of relaxation by NMR may provide us with useful information about their structure, kinetics, and thermodynamics at atomic resolution. However, as these experimental data are sensitive to many structural and dynamic effects, their interpretation with phenomenological models is challenging, even if only a few metastable states are involved. Consequently, approximations and simplifications must often be used which increase the risk of missing important microscopic features hidden in the data. Here, we show how molecular dynamics simulations analyzed through Markov state models and the related hidden Markov state models may be used to establish mechanistic models that provide a microscopic interpretation of NMR relaxation data. Using ubiquitin and BPTI as examples, we demonstrate how the approach allows us to dissect experimental data into a number of dynamic processes between metastable states. Such a microscopic view may greatly facilitate the mechanistic interpretation of experimental data and serve as a next-generation method for the validation of molecular mechanics force fields and chemical shift prediction algorithms.","[Olsson, Simon; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Computat Mol Biol, FB Math & Informat, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Olsson, S; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Computat Mol Biol, FB Math & Informat, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",simon.olsson@fu-berlin.de; frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019","Olsson, Simon/0000-0002-3927-7897","DRSPOINT-Marie Curie COFUND postdoctoral fellowship from Dahlem Research School, Berlin, Germany; European Research Council (pcCell); Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [825/2-2]","We thank Arthur G.

Computational investigations of this process typically involve either building QSAR models or performing free energy calculations of the permeation event. Although insightful, these methods rarely bridge the gap between computation and experiment in a quantitative manner, and identifying structural insights to apply toward the design of compounds with improved permeability can be difficult. In this work, we combine molecular dynamics simulations capturing the kinetic steps of permeation at the atomistic level with a dynamic mechanistic model describing permeation at the in vitro level, finding a high level of agreement with experimental permeation measurements. Calculation of the kinetic rate constants determining each step in the permeation event allows derivation of structure kinetic relationships of permeation. We use these relationships to probe the structural determinants of membrane permeation, finding that the desolvation/loss of hydrogen bonding required to leave the membrane partitioned position controls the membrane flip-flop rate, whereas membrane partitioning determines the rate of leaving the membrane.","[Dickson, Callum J.; Hornak, Viktor; Pearlstein, Robert A.; Duca, Jose S.] Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Comp Aided Drug Discovery, Global Discovery Chem, 181 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Dickson, CJ (corresponding author), Novartis Inst BioMed Res, Comp Aided Drug Discovery, Global Discovery Chem, 181 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",callum.dickson@novartis.com,,,Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research Education Office,We thank Dr. Antonia Mey for assistance with the pyEMMA software and Drs.

It is designed with a particular focus on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change. MSMBuilder is named for its ability to construct Markov state models (MSMs), a class of models that has gained favor among computational biophysicists. In addition to both well-established and newer MSM methods, the package includes complementary algorithms for understanding time-series data such as hidden Markov models and time-structure based independent component analysis. MSMBuilder boasts an easy to use command-line interface, as well as clear and consistent abstractions through its Python application programming interface. MSMBuilder was developed with careful consideration for compatibility with the broader machine learning community by following the design of scikit-learn. The package is used primarily by practitioners of molecular dynamics, but is just as applicable to other computational or experimental time-series measurements.","[Harrigan, Matthew P.; Sultan, Mohammad M.; Husic, Brooke E.; Eastman, Peter; Schwantes, Christian R.; McGibbon, Robert T.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hernandez, Carlos X.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Program Biophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beauchamp, Kyle A.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beauchamp, Kyle A.] Counsyl Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [McGibbon, Robert T.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA","McGibbon, RT; Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Biophys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; McGibbon, RT (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.",robert.mcgibbon@deshawresearch.com; pande@stanford.edu,,"Hernandez, Carlos Xavier/0000-0002-8146-5904","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U19 AI109662, 2R01GM062868, P30CA008747]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0954714]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-114747]; Sloan Kettering Institute; Starr Foundation [I8-A8-058]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662, U19AI109662] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, T32GM008294, R01GM062868] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants U19 AI109662 and 2R01GM062868.

The thrombin-binding DNA aptamer (TBA), is under investigation for anticoagulant drugs. Although aptamer binding experiments have been revealed various effects on thrombin's enzymatic activities, the detailed picture of the thrombin's allostery from TBA binding is still unclear. To investigate thrombin's response to the aptamer-binding at the molecular level, we compare the mechanical properties and free energy landscapes of the free and aptamer-bound thrombin using microsecond-scale all-atom GPU-based molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations on residue fluctuations and coupling illustrate the allosteric effects of aptamer-binding at the atomic level, highlighting the exosite II, 60s,. and the sodium loops, and the alpha helix region in the light chains involved in the allosteric changes. This level of details clarifies the mechanisms of previous experimentally demonstrated phenomena, and provides a prediction of the reduced autolysis rate after aptamer-binding. The shifts in thrombin's ensemble of conformations and free energy surfaces after aptamer-binding demonstrate that the presence of bound-aptamer restricts the conformational freedom of thrombin suggesting that conformational selection, i.e. generalized allostery, is the dominant mechanism of thrombin-aptamer binding. The profound perturbation on thrombin's mechanical and thermodynamic properties due to the aptamer-binding, which was revealed comprehensively as a generalized allostery in this work, may be exploited in further drug discovery and development.","[Xiao, Jiajie; Salsbury, Freddie R., Jr.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Phys, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA","Salsbury, FR (corresponding author), Wake Forest Univ,

For instance, experimental and computational evidence has pointed to lipids influencing receptor oligomerization directly, by physically interacting with the receptor, and/or indirectly, by altering the bulk properties of the membrane. While the exact role of oligomerization in the function of class A GPCRs such as the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is still unclear, insight as to how these receptors oligomerize and the relevance of the lipid environment to this phenomenon is crucial to our understanding of receptor function. To examine the effect of lipids and different MOR conformations on receptor oligomerization we carried out extensive coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of crystal structures of inactive and/or activated MOR embedded in an idealized mammalian plasma membrane composed of 63 lipid types asymmetrically distributed across the two leaflets. The results of these simulations point, for the first time, to specific direct and indirect effects of the lipids, as well as the receptor conformation, on the spatio-temporal organization of MOR in the plasma membrane. While sphingomyelin-rich, high-order lipid regions near certain transmembrane (TM) helices of MOR induce an effective long-range attractive force on individual protomers, both long-range lipid order and interface formation are found to be conformation dependent, with a larger number of different interfaces formed by inactive MOR compared to active MOR.","[Marino, Kristen A.; Prada-Gracia, Diego; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA","Filizola, M (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, New York, NY 10029 USA.",marta.filizola@mssm.edu,"Prada-Gracia, Diego/AAF-2642-2020","Prada-Gracia, Diego/0000-0003-3375-870X; Provasi, Davide/0000-0002-2868-303X; Filizola, Marta/0000-0002-4382-8276","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA038882, DA026434, DA034049]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [K02DA026434, R01DA038882, R01DA038882, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, R01DA038882, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA038882, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, R01DA038882, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD018522] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants DA038882, DA026434, and DA034049.

However, designing opioids with appropriate efficacy and bias is challenging because it requires an understanding of the ligand binding process and of the allosteric modulation of the receptor. Here, we investigated these phenomena for TRV-130, a G protein-biased MOR small-molecule agonist that has been shown to exert analgesia with less respiratory depression and constipation than morphine and that is currently being evaluated in human clinical trials for acute pain management. Specifically, we carried out multimicrosecond, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the binding of this ligand to the activated MOR crystal structure. Analysis of >50 mu s of these MD simulations provides insights into the energetically preferred binding pathway of TRV-130 and its stable pose at the orthosteric binding site of MOR. Information transfer from the TRV-130 binding pocket to the intracellular region of the receptor was also analyzed, and was compared to a similar analysis carried out on the receptor bound to the classical unbiased agonist morphine. Taken together, these studies lead to a series of testable hypotheses of ligand-receptor interactions that are expected to inform the structure-based design of improved opioid analgesics.","[Schneider, Sebastian; Provasi, Davide; Filizola, Marta] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, One Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1677, New York, NY 10029 USA","Filizola, M (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pharmacol Sci, One Gustave L Levy Pl,Box 1677, New York, NY 10029 USA.",marta.filizola@mssm.edu,,"Provasi, Davide/0000-0002-2868-303X","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [DA026434, DA034049, MH107053]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM116961, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, R01GM116961] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH107053, R21MH107053] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, K02DA026434, R01DA034049] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD018522] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants DA026434, DA034049, and MH107053.",,49,42,43,5,36,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0006-2960,,,BIOCHEMISTRY-US,Biochemistry,NOV 22,2016,55,46,,,,,6456,6466,,10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00948,,,11,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,ED5SX,WOS:000388913700011,27778501,Green Accepted,,,2020-11-19,

Markov state models offer a powerful framework for this analysis by describing a system's states and the transitions between them. A recently established variational theorem for Markov state models now enables modelers to systematically determine the best way to describe a system's dynamics. In the context of the variational theorem, we analyze ultra-long folding simulations for a canonical set of twelve proteins [K. Lindorff-Larsen et al., Science 334, 517 (2011)] by creating and evaluating many types of Markov state models. We present a set of guidelines for constructing Markov state models of protein folding; namely, we recommend the use of cross-validation and a kinetically motivated dimensionality reduction step for improved descriptions of folding dynamics. We also warn that precise kinetics predictions rely on the features chosen to describe the system and pose the description of kinetic uncertainty across ensembles of models as an open issue.

Here we define the commute distance that can be shown to be closely related to the expected commute time needed to go from one configuration to the other, and back. A practical merit of this quantity is that it can be easily approximated from molecular dynamics data sets when an approximation of the Markov operator eigenfunctions is available, which can be achieved by the variational approach to approximate eigenfunctions of Markov operators, also called variational approach of conformation dynamics (VAC) or the time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA). The VAC or TICA components can be scaled such that a so-called commute map is obtained in which Euclidean distance corresponds to the commute distance, and thus kinetic models such as Markov state models can be computed based on Euclidean operations, such as standard clustering. In addition, the distance metric gives rise to a quantity we call total kinetic content, which is an excellent score to rank input feature sets and kinetic model quality.","[Noe, Frank; Banisch, Ralf] FU Berlin, Dept Math Comp Sci & Bioinformat, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Noe, F (corresponding author), FU Berlin, Dept Math Comp Sci & Bioinformat, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de; cecilia@rice.edu,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1152344, CHE-1265929]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; European Commission ERC starting Grant [307494-pcCell]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [825/3-1]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1427654] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1265929] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of PhysicsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1427654] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",C.C. is supported by National Science Foundation (Grants CHE-1152344 and CHE-1265929) and the Welch Foundation (Grant C-1570).

Core sets are disjoint metastable regions in the conformational space, which need to be known prior to the construction of the core-set model. We propose to use density-based cluster algorithms to identify the cores. We compare three different density-based cluster algorithms: the CNN, the DBSCAN, and the Jarvis-Patrick algorithm. While the core-set models based on the CNN and DBSCAN clustering are well-converged, constructing core-set models based on the Jarvis-Patrick clustering cannot be recommended. In a well-converged core-set model, the number of core sets is up to an order of magnitude smaller than the number of states in a conventional Markov state model with comparable approximation error. Moreover, using the density-based clustering one can extend the core-set method to systems which are not strongly metastable. This is important for the practical application of the core-set method because most biologically interesting systems are only marginally metastable. The key point is to perform a hierarchical density-based clustering while monitoring the structure of the metric matrix which appears in the core-set method. We test this approach on a molecular-dynamics simulation of a highly flexible 14-residue peptide. The resulting core-set models have a high spatial resolution and can distinguish between conformationally similar yet chemically different structures, such as register-shifted hairpin structures.

Spectral clustering was used to rapidly identify alternative binding site conformations in publicly available crystallographic HSP90-alpha structures. Subsequently, multiple docking and scoring protocols employing the software Autodock Vina and rDock were applied to predict binding modes and rank order ligands. Alchemical free energy calculations were performed with the software FESetup and Sire/OpenMM to predict binding affinities for three congeneric series subsets. Some of the protocols used here were ranked among the top submissions according to most of the evaluation metrics. Docking performance was excellent, but the scoring results were disappointing. A critical assessment of the results is reported, as well as suggestions for future similar competitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Mey, Antonia S. J.

During AIS establishment, a membrane diffusion barrier is formed between the axonal and somatodendritic domains. Recently, an axonal periodic pattern of actin, spectrin, and ankyrin forming 190-nm-spaced, ring-like structures has been discovered. However, whether this structure is related to the diffusion barrier function is unclear. Here, we performed single particle tracking time-course experiments on hippocampal neurons during AIS development. We analyzed the mobility of lipid-anchored molecules by high-speed single-particle tracking and correlated positions of membrane molecules with the nanoscopic organization of the AIS cytoskeleton. We observe a strong reduction in mobility early in AIS development. Membrane protein motion in the AIS plasma membrane is confined to a repetitive pattern of 190-nm-spaced segments along the AIS axis as early as day in vitro 4, and this pattern alternates with actin rings. Mathematical modeling shows that diffusion barriers between the segments significantly reduce lateral diffusion along the axon.","[Albrecht, David; Ewers, Helge] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Sadeghi, Mohsen; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Albrecht, David; Winterflood, Christian M.; Ewers, Helge] Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England; [Albrecht, David; Winterflood, Christian M.; Tschager, Thomas; Ewers, Helge] ETH, Inst Biochem, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Ewers, H (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Chem & Biochem, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Ewers, H (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Randall Div Cell & Mol Biophys, London SE1 1UL, England.; Ewers, H (corresponding author), ETH, Inst Biochem, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",helge.ewers@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324; Winterflood, Christian/0000-0001-5621-3695; Ewers, Helge/0000-0003-3948-4332; Albrecht, David/0000-0001-9455-1134; Sadeghi, Mohsen/0000-0002-7698-5630","Marie Curie Actions grant (FP7-PEOPLE-IEF) [630024]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung Sinergia [CRS113_141945]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB958, SFB1114/Project C03]","The authors acknowledge support from Marie Curie Actions grant (FP7-PEOPLE-2013-IEF 630024, to C.M.

However, functional changes are not easily explained by differences in crystal structures. We employ Markov state models to identify hidden conformations and explore their role in determining TEM's specificity. We integrate these models with existing drug-design tools to create a new technique, called Boltzmann docking, which better predicts TEM specificity by accounting for conformational heterogeneity. Using our MSMs, we identify hidden states whose populations correlate with activity against cefotaxime. To experimentally detect our predicted hidden states, we use rapid mass spectrometric footprinting and confirm our models' prediction that increased cefotaxime activity correlates with reduced Omega-loop flexibility. Finally, we design novel variants to stabilize the hidden cefotaximase states, and find their populations predict activity against cefotaxime in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we expect this framework to have numerous applications in drug and protein design.","[Hart, Kathryn M.; Ho, Chris M.

The reduced molecular friction of the CG representation usually results in faster, albeit inconsistent, dynamics. In this work, we rely on Markov state models to simultaneously characterize the static and kinetic properties of two CG peptide force fields-one top-down and one bottom-up. Instead of a rigorous evolution of CG dynamics (e.g., using a generalized Langevin equation), we attempt to improve the description of kinetics by simply altering the existing CG models, which employ standard Langevin dynamics. By varying masses and relevant force-field parameters, we can improve the timescale separation of the slow kinetic processes, achieve a more consistent ratio of mean-first-passage times between metastable states, and refine the relative free-energies between these states. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of kinetic information into a structure-based parametrization improves the description of the helix-coil transition sampled by a minimal CG model. While structure-based models understabilize the helical state, kinetic constraints help identify CG models that improve the ratio of forward/backward timescales by effectively hindering the sampling of spurious conformational intermediate states.","[Rudzinski, J.

The result is a lower dimensional stochastic model which, by construction, provides the optimal coarse-grained Markovian representation of the system's relaxation kinetics. To illustrate and validate our theory, we analyze a number of test systems of increasing complexity, ranging from synthetic toy models to two realistic applications, built form all-atom MD simulations.

Here we establish a protocol to determine atomistic thermodynamic models of such systems using high-resolution solution state nuclear magnetic resonance data and extensive molecular simulations.

In a typical US stratification strategy, biasing window potentials spanning the subspace of interest are introduced to narrow down the range of accessible conformations and accelerate the sampling. The speed of convergence in each biased window simulation may, however, differ. For example, windows that coincide with a large energetic barrier along a coordinate that is orthogonal to the predefined subspace are often plagued by slow relaxation timescales. Here, we design a method that can quantitatively detect this type of issue and gain further insight into the origin of the slow relaxation timescale. Once the problematic windows affected by slow convergence are identified, additional simulations limited to only these windows can be carried out, thereby reducing the overall computational effort. Several possible approaches aimed at performing US simulations adaptively are discussed, and their respective performance is illustrated using a simple model system. Last, simulations of an atomic deca-alanine system are used to demonstrate the efficacy of analyzing US simulation trajectories using the proposed method.","[Jo, Sunhwan] Argonne Natl Lab, Leadership Comp Facil, 9700 Cass Ave,Bldg 240, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Suh, Donghyuk; He, Ziwei] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chipot, Christophe] CNRS, Lab Int Associe, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Lorraine, Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign, UMR 7565, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 West Green St,405 North Mathews, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chipot, Christophe] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Res & Technol, 1110 West Green St,405 North Mathews, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Roux, Benoit] Univ Chicago, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Roux, Benoit] Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanomat, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA","Roux, B (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Gordon Ctr Integrat Sci, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Roux, B (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Nanomat, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",roux@uchicago.edu,,,DOE Oce of Science User FacilityUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; Computational Post- doctoral Fellowship from ALCF; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1517221]; France and Chicago Collaborating in the Sciences (FACCTS) Center of the University of Chicago; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1517221] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors would like to acknowledge Frank Noe and Christoph Wehmeyer at Freie Universitaet Berlin for helpful discussions and comments.

We minimize the effects of Kramers-type recrossings by assigning conformational states based on their sequential time evolution. Transition rates are further estimated from short-time state propagators by maximizing the likelihood that the extracted rates agree with the observed atomistic trajectories without any a priori assumptions about their temperature dependence. Here, we evaluate the rates for both continuous replica trajectories that visit different temperatures and for discontinuous data corresponding to each REMD temperature. While the binding-unbinding kinetic process is clearly Markovian, the conformational dynamics of the bound NNQQ dimer has a complex character. Our kinetic analysis allows us to discriminate between short-lived encounter pairs and strongly bound conformational states. The conformational dynamics of NNQQ dimers supports a kinetically driven aggregation mechanism, in agreement with the polymorphic character reported for amyloid aggregates such as microcrystals and fibrils.","[Leahy, Cathal T.; Murphy, Ronan D.; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Leahy, Cathal T.; Murphy, Ronan D.; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Hummer, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Rosta, Edina] Kings Coll London, Dept Chem, London SE1 1DB, England","Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland.; Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Complex & Adapt Syst Lab, Dublin 4, Ireland.",buchete@ucd.ie,"Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013","Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X; Rosta, Edina/0000-0002-9823-4766; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel/0000-0001-9861-1157","Irish Research Council (IRC)Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N020669/1]; DJEI/DES/SFI/HEA Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC)Science Foundation Ireland; Biowulf cluster at the National Institutes of Health, United StatesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/M022609/1, EP/N020669/1, EP/L000253/1] Funding Source: researchfish","We thank Drs.

Recent isotope-edited IR spectroscopy suggests that conformational heterogeneity exists within the Michaelis complex of LDH, and this heterogeneity affects the propensity toward the on-enzyme chemical step for each Michaelis substate. By combining molecular dynamics simulations with Markov and hidden Markov models, we obtained a detailed kinetic network of the substates of the Michaelis complex of LDH. The ensemble-average electric fields exerted onto the vibrational probe were calculated to provide a direct comparison with the vibrational spectroscopy. Structural features of the Michaelis substates were also analyzed on atomistic scales. Our work not only clearly demonstrates the conformational heterogeneity in the Michaelis complex of LDH and its coupling to the reactivities of the substates, but it also suggests a methodology to simultaneously resolve kinetics and structures on atomistic scales, which can be directly compared with the vibrational spectroscopy.","[Pan, Xiaoliang; Schwartz, Steven D.] Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, 1306 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA","Schwartz, SD (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Chem & Biochem, 1306 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",sschwartz@email.arizona.edu,"Pan, Xiaoliang/F-8632-2010","Pan, Xiaoliang/0000-0002-6399-4853","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM068036]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036, P01GM068036] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors acknowledge the support from National Institutes of Health Grant GM068036.,,47,10,10,1,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

The method is based on the idea that ensembles of three-dimensional fragments extracted from high-resolution crystal structures are heterogeneous enough to describe metastable as well as intermediate states. These ensembles are first validated by performing a quantitative comparison against available solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data of a set of RNA tetranucleotides. Notably, the agreement is better with respect to the one obtained by comparing NMR with extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We then propose a procedure based on diffusion maps and Markov models that makes it possible to obtain reaction pathways and their relative probabilities from fragment ensembles. This approach is applied to study the helix-to-loop folding pathway of all the tetraloops from the GNRA and UNCG families. The results give detailed insights into the folding mechanism that are compatible with available experimental data and clarify the role of intermediate states observed in previous simulation studies. The method is computationally inexpensive and can be used to study arbitrary conformational transitions.","[Bottaro, Sandro; Gil-Ley, Alejandro; Bussi, Giovanni] Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, Int Sch Adv Studies, 265 Via Bonomea, I-34136 Trieste, Italy","Bottaro, S; Bussi, G (corresponding author), Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, Int Sch Adv Studies, 265 Via Bonomea, I-34136 Trieste, Italy.",sbottaro@sissa.it; bussi@sissa.it,"Bottaro, Sandro/H-5486-2013; Gil-Ley, Alejandro/J-5851-2012; Bussi, Giovanni/A-1776-2009","Bottaro, Sandro/0000-0003-1606-890X; Gil-Ley, Alejandro/0000-0002-0696-1609; Bussi, Giovanni/0000-0001-9216-5782",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme/ERC [S-RNA-S] [306662],"European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP/2007-2013]/ERC [306662, S-RNA-S].",,62,23,23,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-1048,1362-4962,,NUCLEIC ACIDS RES,Nucleic Acids Res.,JUL 8,2016,44,12,,,,,5883,5891,,10.1093/nar/gkw239,,,9,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,DT0ZG,WOS:000381210900036,27091499,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-11-19,

TRAM estimates a multiensemble Markov model (MEMM) with full thermodynamic and kinetic information at all ensembles. The approach combines the benefits of Markov statemodels-clustering of high-dimensional spaces and modeling of complex many-state systems-with those of the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio of exploiting biased or high-temperature ensembles to accelerate rare-event sampling. TRAM does not depend on any rate model in addition to the widely used Markov state model approximation, but uses only fundamental relations such as detailed balance and binless reweighting of configurations between ensembles. Previous methods, including the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, discrete TRAM, and Markov state models are special cases and can be derived from the TRAM equations. TRAM is demonstrated by efficiently computing MEMMs in cases where other estimators break down, including the full thermodynamics and rare-event kinetics from high-dimensional simulation data of an all-atom protein-ligand binding model.","[Wu, Hao; Paul, Fabian; Wehmeyer, Christoph; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Wehmeyer, Christoph/A-3410-2011","Wehmeyer, Christoph/0000-0002-9526-0328",,,,79,94,95,0,42,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

However, discretization of the conformational space remains a primary challenge in model building, and it is not clear how the space decomposition by distinct clustering strategies exerts influence on the model output. In this work, different clustering algorithms are employed to partition the conformational space sampled in opening and closing of fatty acid binding protein 4 as well as inactivation and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Various classifications are achieved, and Markov models are set up accordingly. On the basis of the models, the total net flux and transition rate are calculated between two distinct states. Our results indicate that geometric and kinetic clustering perform equally well. The construction and outcome of Markov models are heavily dependent on the data traits. Compared to other methods, a combination of Bayesian and hierarchical clustering is feasible in identification of metastable states.","[Li, Yan; Dong, Zigang] Univ Minnesota, Hormel Inst, Austin, MN 55912 USA","Li, Y; Dong, ZG (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hormel Inst, Austin, MN 55912 USA.",yanli0208@hi.umn.edu; zgdong@hi.umn.edu,,,"Hormel Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CA172457, CA166011, R37 CA081064]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [R37CA081064, R37CA081064, R37CA081064, R37CA081064, R37CA081064, R37CA081064] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by The Hormel Foundation and National Institutes of Health, Grants CA172457, CA166011, and R37 CA081064.",,41,11,11,0,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,1549-960X,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.

Apart from Cartesian coordinates, internal coordinates, e.g., backbone dihedral angles or various kinds of distances, may be used as input data in a PCA. Adopting two well-known model problems, folding of villin headpiece and the functional dynamics of BPTI, a systematic study of PCA using distance-based measures is presented which employs distances between Ca-atoms as well as distances between inter-residue contacts including side chains. While this approach seems prohibitive for larger systems due to the quadratic scaling of the number of distances with the size of the molecule, it is shown that it is sufficient (and sometimes even better) to include only relatively few selected distances in the analysis. The quality of the PCA is assessed by considering the resolution of the resulting free energy landscape (to identify metastable conformational states and barriers) and the decay behavior of the corresponding autocorrelation functions (to test the time scale separation of the PCA). By comparing results obtained with distance-based, dihedral angle, and Cartesian coordinates, the study shows that the choice of input variables may drastically influence the outcome of a PCA.

In the Diffusion Map approach, one assumes that the molecular configurations sampled have been generated by a diffusion process, and one uses the eigenfunctions of the corresponding diffusion operator as reaction coordinates. While diffusion coordinates (DCs) appear to provide a good approximation to the true dynamical reaction coordinates, they are not parametrized using dynamical information. Thus, their approximation quality could not, as yet, be validated, nor could the diffusion map eigenvalues be used to compute relaxation rate constants of the system. Here we combine the Diffusion Map approach with the recently proposed Variational Approach for Conformation Dynamics (VAC). Diffusion Map coordinates are used as a basis set, and their optimal linear combination is sought using the VAC, which employs time-correlation information on the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. We have applied this approach to ultra-long MD simulations of the Fip35 WW domain and found that the first DCs are indeed a good approximation to the true reaction coordinates of the system, but they could be further improved using the VAC. Using the Diffusion Map basis, excellent approximations to the relaxation rates of the system are obtained. Finally, we evaluate the quality of different metric spaces and find that pairwise minimal root-mean-square deviation performs poorly, while operating in the recently introduced kinetic maps based on the time-lagged independent component analysis gives the best performance.","[Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Gobbo, Gianpaolo] Univ Edinburgh, Maxwell Inst Math Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Gobbo, Gianpaolo] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Math, Edinburgh EH9 3FD, Midlothian, Scotland; [Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math Comp Sci & Bioinformat, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math Comp Sci & Bioinformat, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de; cecilia@rice.edu,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Gobbo, Gianpaolo/0000-0002-8294-6152","ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [307494-pcCell]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [825/3-1]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1152344, CHE-1265929]; Welch foundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K039512/1]; Data Analysis and Visualization Cyber Infrastructure - NSF [OCI-0959097]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NCRR S10RR02950]; IBM Shared University Research (SUR) Award; CISCO; Qlogic; Adaptive Computing; NATIONAL CENTER FOR RESEARCH RESOURCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [S10RR002950] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K039512/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1427654] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of ChemistryNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1265929, 1152344] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of PhysicsNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1427654] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We acknowledge funding from the following grants: ERC starting grant 307494-pcCell and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft NO 825/3-1 (F.N.), National Science Foundation CHE-1152344 and CHE-1265929, Welch foundation C-1570 (C.C.), and EPSRC Grant No. EP/K039512/1 (G.G.).
