This approach has been particularly successful for molecular dynamics data, where slowly decorrelating patterns can indicate large-scale conformational changes. Detecting such patterns is the central objective of the variational approach to conformational dynamics (VAC), as well as the related methods of time-lagged independent component analysis and Markov state modeling. In VAC, the search for slowly decorrelating patterns is formalized as a variational problem solved by the eigenfunctions of the system's transition operator. VAC computes solutions to this variational problem by optimizing a linear or nonlinear model of the eigenfunctions using time series data. Here, we build on VAC's success by addressing two practical limitations. First, VAC can give poor eigenfunction estimates when the lag time parameter is chosen poorly. Second, VAC can overfit when using flexible parametrizations such as artificial neural networks with insufficient regularization. To address these issues, we propose an extension that we call integrated VAC (IVAC). IVAC integrates over multiple lag times before solving the variational problem, making its results more robust and reproducible than VAC's.","[Lorpaiboon, Chatipat; Dinner, Aaron R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lorpaiboon, Chatipat; Dinner, Aaron R.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Thiede, Erik Henning] Flatiron Inst, New York, NY 60637 USA; [Thiede, Erik Henning] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Webber, Robert J.; Weare, Jonathan] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA","Lorpaiboon, C; Dinner, AR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Lorpaiboon, C; Dinner, AR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Thiede, EH (corresponding author), Flatiron Inst, New York, NY 60637 USA.; Thiede, EH (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Webber, RJ; Weare, J (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, New York, NY 10012 USA.",chatipat@uchicago.edu; thiede@uchicago.edu; rw2515@nyu.edu; weare@cims.nyu.edu; dinner@uchicago.edu,,"Dinner, Aaron/0000-0001-8328-6427",DARPAUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [HR00111890038]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-1646339]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R35 GM136381]; Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program within the DOE Office of Science [DE-SC0020427],"E.H.T. was supported by DARPA grant HR00111890038.

The minimum number of variables required is called the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the data. Contrary to common intuition, there are cases where the ID varies within the same data set. This fact has been highlighted in technical discussions, but seldom exploited to analyze large data sets and obtain insight into their structure. Here we develop a robust approach to discriminate regions with different local IDs and segment the points accordingly. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be proficiently used even on large data sets. We find that many real-world data sets contain regions with widely heterogeneous dimensions. These regions host points differing in core properties: folded versus unfolded configurations in a protein molecular dynamics trajectory, active versus non-active regions in brain imaging data, and firms with different financial risk in company balance sheets. A simple topological feature, the local ID, is thus sufficient to achieve an unsupervised segmentation of high-dimensional data, complementary to the one given by clustering algorithms.","[Allegra, Michele] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7289, Inst Neurosci Timone, F-13385 Marseille, France; [Allegra, Michele; Facco, Elena; Laio, Alessandro] Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, Trieste, Italy; [Denti, Francesco] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Laio, Alessandro] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy; [Mira, Antonietta] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland; [Mira, Antonietta] Univ Insubria, Como, Italy","Laio, A (corresponding author), Scuola Int Super Studi Avanzati, Trieste, Italy.; Laio, A (corresponding author), Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Trieste, Italy.; Mira, A (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.; Mira, A (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Como, Italy.",laio@sissa.it; antonietta.mira@usi.ch,,,Horizon 2020 FLAG-ERA (European Union)European Union (EU) [ANR-17-HBPR-0001-02]; SNF [100018_172892],"M.A. was supported by Horizon 2020 FLAG-ERA (European Union), grant ANR-17-HBPR-0001-02 during completion of this work.

The sequence of amino acids of a protein encodes its phase behaviour, not only by establishing the patterning and chemical nature (e.g., hydrophobic, polar, charged) of the various binding sites that facilitate multivalent interactions, but also by dictating the protein conformational dynamics. Besides behaving as random coils, IDRs can exhibit a wide-range of structural behaviours, including conformational switching, where they transition between alternate conformational ensembles. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations of a minimal coarse-grained model for IDRs, we show that the role of protein conformation has a non-trivial effect in the liquid-liquid phase behaviour of IDRs. When an IDR transitions to a conformational ensemble enriched in disordered extended states, LLPS is enhanced. In contrast, IDRs that switch to ensembles that preferentially sample more compact and structured states show inhibited LLPS. This occurs because extended and disordered protein conformations facilitate LLPS-stabilising multivalent protein-protein interactions by reducing steric hindrance; thereby, such conformations maximize the molecular connectivity of the condensed liquid network. Extended protein configurations promote phase separation regardless of whether LLPS is driven by homotypic and/or heterotypic protein-protein interactions. This study sheds light on the link between the dynamic conformational plasticity of IDRs and their liquid-liquid phase behaviour.","[Garaizar, Adiran; Sanchez-Burgos, Ignacio; Collepardo-Guevara, Rosana; Espinosa, Jorge R.] Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Maxwell Ctr, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Collepardo-Guevara, Rosana] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England; [Collepardo-Guevara, Rosana] Univ Cambridge, Dept Genet, Downing Site, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England","Espinosa, JR (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Cavendish Lab, Dept Phys, Maxwell Ctr, JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",ag949@cam.ac.uk; is490@cam.ac.uk; rc597@cam.ac.uk; jr752@cam.ac.uk,,"Sanchez-Burgos, Ignacio/0000-0002-1160-3945; Garaizar, Adiran/0000-0002-9320-2984","European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [803326]; EPSRC scholarshipEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N509620/1]; Oppenheimer Fellowship; Emmanuel College Roger Ekins Research Fellowship; Derek Brewer scholarship from Emmanuel College - EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P020259/1, T2-CS092-CPU]",This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 803326).

Understanding how the protein folds under physical principles, known as the protein folding problem, is one of the main tasks in modern biophysics. Coarse-grained methods play an increasingly important role in the simulation of protein folding, especially for large proteins. In recent years, we proposed a novel coarse-grained method derived from the topological soliton model, in terms of the backbone C(alpha)chain. In this review, we will first systematically address the theoretical method of topological soliton. Then some successful applications will be displayed, including the thermodynamics simulation of protein folding, the property analysis of dynamic conformations, and the multi-scale simulation scheme.

Examples range from chemical reactions, protein folding, and nucleation events to the catastrophic failure of bridges. A challenge in understanding the underlying mechanisms is that the most interesting information is contained within the rare transition paths, the exceedingly short periods when the barrier is crossed. To establish a model process that enables access to all relevant timescales, although highly disparate, we probe the dynamics of single dielectric particles in a bistable optical trap in solution. Precise localization by high-speed tracking enables us to resolve the transition paths and relate them to the detailed properties of the 3D potential within which the particle diffuses.

Markov state models (MSMs) and equation-free approaches learn low-dimensional kinetic models from MD simulation data by performing configurational or dynamical coarse-graining of the state space. The learned kinetic models enable the efficient generation of dynamical trajectories over vastly longer time scales than are accessible by MD, but the discretization of configurational space and/or absence of a means to reconstruct molecular configurations precludes the generation of continuous atomistic molecular trajectories. We propose latent space simulators (LSS) to learn kinetic models for continuous atomistic simulation trajectories by training three deep learning networks to (i) learn the slow collective variables of the molecular system, (ii) propagate the system dynamics within this slow latent space, and (iii) generatively reconstruct molecular configurations. We demonstrate the approach in an application to Trp-cage miniprotein to produce novel ultra-long synthetic folding trajectories that accurately reproduce atomistic molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics at six orders of magnitude lower cost than MD.

The coupled NH is defined by suitably combining the NH EOM of the PS and the NH EOM of the temperature system (TS), where the inverse heat-bath temperature beta is a dynamical variable. In this study, we developed a method to determine the effective weight for beta for enhanced sampling of PS states. The method, based on ergodic theory, is reliable, and eliminates the need for time-consuming iterative procedures and resource-consuming replica systems. The resulting TS potential in a two dimensional (beta,epsilon)-space makes a valley-shape, where the potential minimum path provides a route for beta and epsilon and guides their motions.beta oscillates around the potential minima for each energy epsilon, and the motion of beta derives a motion of epsilon and receives the epsilon's feedback, which leads to amutual boosteffect. Thus, it also provides a specific dynamical mechanism to explain the features of enhanced sampling such that the temperature-space 'random walk' enhances the energy-space 'random walk.'

Here, we introduce such a reaction coordinate, which does not depend on previous structural knowledge of the native state but relies solely on the energy partition within the protein: the spectral gap of the pair nonbonded energy matrix (ENergy Gap, ENG). This quantity can be simply calculated along unbiased MD trajectories. We show that upon folding the gap increases significantly, while its fluctuations are reduced to a minimum. This is consistently observed for a diverse set of systems and trajectories. Our approach allows one to promptly identify residues that belong to the folding core as well as residues involved in non-native contacts that need to be disrupted to guide polypeptides to the folded state. The energy gap and fluctuations criteria are then used to develop an automatic detection system which allows us to extract and analyze folding transitions from a generic MD trajectory. We speculate that our method can be used to detect conformational ensembles in dynamic and intrinsically disordered proteins, revealing potential preorganization for binding.","[Meli, Massimiliano; Morra, Giulia; Colombo, Giorgio] SCITEC CNR, I-20131 Milan, Italy; [Morra, Giulia] Weill Cornell Med, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Colombo, Giorgio] Univ Pavia, Dept Chem, I-27100 Pavia, Italy","Morra, G; Colombo, G (corresponding author), SCITEC CNR, I-20131 Milan, Italy.; Morra, G (corresponding author), Weill Cornell Med, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Colombo, G (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Chem, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",giulia.morra@scitec.cnr.it; g.colombo@unipv.it,"; Colombo, Giorgio/A-2730-2012","Meli, Massimiliano/0000-0003-3304-6104; Colombo, Giorgio/0000-0002-1318-668X",AIRCAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC) [IG 20019],We acknowledge funding from AIRC through grant IG 20019 to G.C.,,61,0,0,3,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

To reach the high power conversion efficiency of HSC, the morphology of the photoactive layer for providing optimal charge transport paths is designed. Herein, the coarse-grained model for predicting the morphology of nanocomposites based on semiconducting CPs and NPs is used. For polymer matrix, well-known CPs such as poly(3-hexythiophene) (P3HT), poly [thieno [3,4-b] thiophene/benzodithiophen] (PTB7), and poly [[2,6 '-4,8- di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b] dithiophene][3-fluoro- 2[(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) are selected. For NP fillers, PbS quantum dots modified by ligands (like, e.g., oleic acid) are selected. Via mesoscale computer simulations, it is shown that by choosing appropriate ligands for NPs and varying the weight fraction of NPs, the morphology with bicontinuous charge transport paths for holes and electrons is obtained. Such morphologies are observed in models of homopolymer/NP blends for the first time. This finding is in reasonable agreement with the recent experimental results on these systems.","[Komarov, Pavel V.; Khokhlov, Alexei R.] RAS, Lab Phys Chem Polymers, AN Nesmeyanov Inst Organoelement Cpds, Vavilova St 28, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Komarov, Pavel V.] Tver State Univ, Gen Phys Dept, Sadovii Per 35, Tver 170002, Russia; [Baburkin, Pavel O.] Tver State Univ, Dept Phys Chem, Sadovii Per 35, Tver 170002, Russia; [Ivanov, Viktor A.; Khokhlov, Alexei R.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Phys, Leninskie Gory 1, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Ivanov, Viktor A.] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Phys, D-06120 Halle, Germany; [Li, Yi-Lun; Chen, Show-An] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan","Komarov, PV (corresponding author), RAS, Lab Phys Chem Polymers, AN Nesmeyanov Inst Organoelement Cpds, Vavilova St 28, Moscow 119991, Russia.; Komarov, PV (corresponding author), Tver State Univ, Gen Phys Dept, Sadovii Per 35, Tver 170002, Russia.",komarov.pv@tversu.ru,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project RFBR ) [17-53-52009]; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2923-E007-001-MY3]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","The research was conducted using the equipment of the shared research facilities of HPC computing resources at Lomonosov Moscow State University.<SUP>[110]</SUP> The financial support by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Project RFBR no. 17-53-52009), the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (Project MOST 106-2923-E007-001-MY3), and Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation are highly appreciated.",,107,0,0,2,2,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2367-198X,,,SOL RRL,Sol.

Near the neutral pH and at a low buffer ionic strength, the formation of the gel network around unfolding conditions prevents investigations of protein aggregation. In this study, by deploying the fact that in lysozyme solutions the time of folding/unfolding is much shorter than the characteristic time of gelation, we have prevented gelation by rapidly heating the solution up to the unfolding temperature (similar to 80 degrees C) for a short time (similar to 30 min.) followed by fast cooling to the room temperature. Dynamic light scattering measurements show that if the gelation is prevented, nanosized irreversible aggregates (about 10-15 nm radius) form over a time scale of 10 days. These small aggregates persist and aggregate further into larger aggregates over several weeks. If gelation is not prevented, the nanosized aggregates become the building blocks for the gel network and define its mesh length scale. These results support our previously published conclusion on the nature of mesoscopic aggregates commonly observed in solutions of lysozyme, namely that aggregates do not form from lysozyme monomers in their native folded state. Only with the emergence of a small fraction of unfolded proteins molecules will the aggregates start to appear and grow.","[Nikfarjam, Shakiba; Anisimov, Mikhail A.; Woehl, Taylor J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jouravleva, Elena V.; Anisimov, Mikhail A.] Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Anisimov, MA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Anisimov, MA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Inst Phys Sci & Technol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",shnikfar@umd.edu; ejouravl@umd.edu; anisimov@umd.edu; tjwoehl@umd.edu,,,American Chemical Society Petroleum Research FundAmerican Chemical Society [59 434-ND6]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1856479]; Maryland Industrial Partnerships program,"This research was funded by American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, Grant no. 59 434-ND6.

We introduce an updated energy model that efficiently captures the energetic effects of these ordered water molecules on the surfaces of proteins. A two-stage method is developed in which polar groups arranged in geometries suitable for water placement are first identified, then a modified Monte Carlo simulation allows highly coordinated waters to be placed on the surface of a protein while simultaneously sampling amino acid side chain orientations. This semi-explicit water model is implemented in Rosetta and is suitable for both structure prediction and protein design. We show that our new approach and energy model yield significant improvements in native structure recovery of protein-protein and protein-ligand docking discrimination tests. Author summary Well-coordinated water molecules-those forming multiple hydrogen bonds with nearby polar groups-play an important role in the structure of biomolecular systems, yet the effect of these waters is often not considered in molecular energy computations. In this paper, we describe a method to efficiently consider these water molecules both implicitly and explicitly at the interfaces formed by two polar molecules. In computations related to determining how a protein interacts with binding partners, we show that the use of this new method significantly improves results.

By propagating the information encoded in their conformation, prions exemplify the phenomenon of protein-based inheritance. These peculiar agents are associated with neurodegenerative pathologies in mammals, but also involved in a wide variety of physiological processes occurring in various biological contexts along the evolutionary scale. In this work, we apply a recently developed computational method to study the propagation mechanism of the fungal prion HET-s, using a realistic all-atom model. We find that the replication of HET-s shares fundamental features with the templated conversion of the mammalian prion PrPSc. Prions are self-replicative protein particles lacking nucleic acids. Originally discovered for causing infectious neurodegenerative disorders, they have also been found to play several physiological roles in a variety of species. Functional and pathogenic prions share a common mechanism of replication, characterized by the ability of an amyloid conformer to propagate by inducing the conversion of its physiological, soluble counterpart. Since time-resolved biophysical experiments are currently unable to provide full reconstruction of the physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for prion replication, one must rely on computer simulations. In this work, we show that a recently developed algorithm called Self-Consistent Path Sampling (SCPS) overcomes the computational limitations of plain MD and provides a viable tool to investigate prion replication processes using state-of-the-art all-atom force fields in explicit solvent. First, we validate the reliability of SCPS simulations by characterizing the folding of a class of small proteins and comparing against the results of plain MD simulations. Next, we use SCPS to investigate the replication of the prion forming domain of HET-s, a physiological fungal prion for which high-resolution structural data are available. Our atomistic reconstruction shows remarkable similarities with a previously reported mechanism of mammalian PrP(Sc)propagation obtained using a simpler and more approximate path sampling algorithm. Together, these results suggest that the propagation of prions generated by evolutionary distant proteins may share common features. In particular, in both these cases, prions propagate their conformation through a very similar templating mechanism.","[Terruzzi, Luca; Boldrini, Alberto] Sibylla Biotech SRL, Verona, Italy; [Terruzzi, Luca; Spagnolli, Giovanni; Boldrini, Alberto; Biasini, Emiliano] Univ Trento, Dept Cellular Computat & Integrat Biol CIBIO, Povo, Trento, Italy; [Spagnolli, Giovanni; Biasini, Emiliano] Univ Trento, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, Povo, Trento, Italy; [Requena, Jesus R.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, CIMUS Biomed Res Inst, IDIS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Requena, Jesus R.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Med Sci, IDIS, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Faccioli, Pietro] Univ Trento, Dept Phys, Povo, Trento, Italy; [Faccioli, Pietro] Univ Trento, INFN TIFPA, Povo, Trento, Italy","Spagnolli, G; Biasini, E (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Cellular Computat & Integrat Biol CIBIO, Povo, Trento, Italy.; Spagnolli, G; Biasini, E (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dulbecco Telethon Inst, Povo, Trento, Italy.; Faccioli, P (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Phys, Povo, Trento, Italy.; Faccioli, P (corresponding author), Univ Trento, INFN TIFPA, Povo, Trento, Italy.",giovanni.spagnolli@unitn.it; emiliano.biasini@unitn.it; pietro.faccioli@unitn.it,,"Terruzzi, Luca/0000-0003-2491-0415",Fondazione Telethon (Italy)Fondazione Telethon [TCP14009]; Fondazione TelethonFondazione Telethon,"This work was partially supported by a grant from Fondazione Telethon (Italy, TCP14009).

One route to distinguish real protein structures from decoys is to delineate the important physical features that specify a real protein. For example, it has long been appreciated that the hydrophobic cores of proteins contribute significantly to their stability. We used two sources to obtain datasets of decoys to compare with real protein structures: submissions to the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction competition, in which researchers attempt to predict the structure of a protein only knowing its amino acid sequence, and also decoys generated by 3DRobot, which have user-specified global root-mean-squared deviations from experimentally determined structures. Our analysis revealed that both sets of decoys possess cores that do not recapitulate the key features that define real protein cores. In particular, the model structures appear more densely packed (because of energetically unfavorable atomic overlaps), contain too few residues in the core, and have improper distributions of hydrophobic residues throughout the structure. Based on these observations, we developed a feed-forward neural network, which incorporates key physical features of protein cores, to predict how well a computational model recapitulates the real protein structure without knowledge of the structure of the target sequence. By identifying the important features of protein structure, our method is able to rank decoy structures with similar accuracy to that obtained by state-of-the-art methods that incorporate many additional features. The small number of physical features makes our model interpretable, emphasizing the importance of protein packing and hydrophobicity in protein structure prediction.","[Grigas, Alex T.; O'Hern, Corey S.] Yale Univ, Grad Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Grigas, Alex T.; Mei, Zhe; Treado, John D.; O'Hern, Corey S.] Yale Univ, Integrated Grad Program Phys & Engn Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Mei, Zhe] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Treado, John D.; O'Hern, Corey S.] Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Levine, Zachary A.] Yale Univ, Dept Pathol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Levine, Zachary A.] Yale Univ, Dept Mol Biophys & Biochem, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Regan, Lynne] Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Synthet & Syst Biol, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Quantitat Biol Biochem & Biotechnol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [O'Hern, Corey S.] Yale Univ, Dept Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [O'Hern, Corey S.] Yale Univ, Dept Appl Phys, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","O'Hern, CS (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",corey.ohern@yale.edu,"O'Hern, Corey/I-3459-2014","O'Hern, Corey/0000-0002-8272-5640; Grigas, Alex/0000-0002-1588-2996",,,,77,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,SEP,2020,29,9,,,,,1931,1944,,10.1002/pro.3914,,,14,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,NF2ZE,WOS:000563167200007,32710566,,,,19/11/2020

However, unlike the mature deployment of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, its development in molecular modeling and simulations is still at an early stage, largely because the inductive biases of molecules are completely different from those of images or texts. Footed on these differences, we first reviewed the limitations of traditional deep learning models from the perspective of molecular physics and wrapped up some relevant technical advancement at the interface between molecular modeling and deep learning. We do not focus merely on the ever more complex neural network models; instead, we introduce various useful concepts and ideas brought by modern deep learning. We hope that transacting these ideas into molecular modeling will create new opportunities. For this purpose, we summarized several representative applications, ranging from supervised to unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and discussed their connections with the emerging trends in deep learning. Finally, we give an outlook for promising directions which may help address the existing issues in the current framework of deep molecular modeling.","[Zhang, Jun; Li, Maodong; Yang, Yi Isaac; Gao, Yi Qin] Shenzhen Bay Lab, Inst Syst & Phys Biol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Lei, Yao-Kun; Chang, Junhan; Han, Xu; Yang, Lijiang] Peking Univ, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [hZang, Zhen] Tangshan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Tangshan 063000, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yi Qin] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Genom, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yi Qin] Peking Univ, Biomed Pioneering Innovat Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Yang, YI; Gao, YQ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Bay Lab, Inst Syst & Phys Biol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Gao, YQ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Genom, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Gao, YQ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Biomed Pioneering Innovat Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yangyi@szbl.ac.cn; gaoyq@pku.edu.cn,"; Yang, Yi Isaac/F-3803-2015","Zhang, Jun/0000-0002-8760-6747; Yang, Yi Isaac/0000-0002-5599-0975","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21927901, 21821004, 21873007]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0204702]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2019A1515110278]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","The authors thank Linfeng Zhang, Weinan E, Wenjun Xie, Xing Che, and Cheng-Wen Liu for useful discussion.

However, the accessible timescales of MD simulation are shorter than those of the biologically rare events. Generally, long-time MD simulations over microseconds are required to detect the rare events. Therefore, it is desirable to develop rare-event-sampling methods. For a rare-event-sampling method, we have developed parallel cascade selection MD (PaCS-MD). PaCS-MD generates transition pathways from a given source structure to a target structure by repeating short-time MD simulations. The key point in PaCS-MD is how to select reasonable candidates (protein configurations) with high potentials to make transitions toward the target structure. In the present study, based on principal component analysis (PCA), we propose PCA-based PaCS-MD to detect rare events of collective motions of a given protein. Here, the PCA-based PaCS-MD is composed of the following two steps. At first, as a preliminary run, PCA is performed using an MD trajectory from the target structure to define a principal coordinate (PC) subspace for describing the collective motions of interest. PCA provides principal modes as eigenvectors to project a protein configuration onto the PC subspace. Then, as a production run, all the snapshots of short-time MD simulations are ranked by inner products (IPs), where an IP is defined between a snapshot and the target structure. Then, snapshots with higher values of the IP are selected as reasonable candidates, and short-time MD simulations are independently restarted from them. By referring to the values of the IP, the PCA-based PaCS-MD repeats the short-time MD simulations from the reasonable candidates that are highly correlated with the target structure. As a demonstration, we applied the PCA-based PaCS-MD to adenylate kinase and detected its large-amplitude (open-closed) transition with a nanosecond-order computational cost.","[Yasuda, Takunori] Univ Tsukuba, Coll Biol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Shigeta, Yasuteru; Harada, Ryuhei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Harada, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Advancing Researcher Experience (ARE) Program, University of Tsukuba","Part of MD simulations was performed with the computational resource structures of Cygnus provided by the Multidisciplinary Cooperative Research Program in the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), University of Tsukuba.

Broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) is one of the most powerful experimental techniques to monitor, over a broad frequency and temperature range, the molecular dynamics of soft matter through the orientational polarisation of permanent dipole moments that are generated by the chemical structure and morphological organisation of matter. Its typical frequency range goes from 10(7) Hz down to 10(-3) Hz, being thus suitable for investigations on slow motions in proteins. Moreover, BDS has the advantage of providing direct experimental access to molecular fluctuations taking place on different length-scales, from local to cooperative dipolar motions. The unfolding of the cholera toxin B pentamer (CtxB(5)) after thermal treatment for 3h at 80 degrees C is investigated by BDS under nanoconfined and dehydrated conditions. From the X-ray structure of the toxin pentamer, network-based models are used to infer the toxin dipoles present in the native state and to compute their stability and dielectric properties. Network analyses highlight three domains with distinct dielectric and stability properties that support a model where the toxin unfolds into three conformations after the treatment at 80 degrees C. This novel integrative approach offers some perspective into the investigation of the relation between local perturbations (e.g. mutation, thermal treatment) and larger scale protein conformational changes. It might help ranking protein sequence variants according to their respective scale of dynamics perturbations.","[Pacini, Lorenza; Bourgeat, Laetitia; Lesieur, Claire] Univ Lyon, CNRS, AMPERE, F-69622 Lyon, France; [Pacini, Lorenza; Lesieur, Claire] IXXI ENS Lyon, Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Bourgeat, Laetitia; Serghei, Anatoli] Univ Lyon, CNRS, IMP, F-69622 Lyon, France","Lesieur, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, AMPERE, F-69622 Lyon, France.; Lesieur, C (corresponding author), IXXI ENS Lyon, Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, F-69007 Lyon, France.; Serghei, A (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, IMP, F-69622 Lyon, France.",anatoli.serghei@univ-lyon1.fr; claire.lesieur@ens-lyon.fr,,,Interdisciplinary Mission of the CNRS,"The authors thank the Interdisciplinary Mission of the CNRS for funding (MITI, Defi 'Instrumentations aux limites' ATTOGRAM).",,54,1,1,0,0,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0004-9425,1445-0038,,AUST J CHEM,Aust.

They are also a means to investigate free energy landscapes. Protein force spectroscopy alone provides limited information; theoretical models relate measurements to thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein, but do not reveal atomic level information. By building a molecular model of the protein and probing its properties through numerical simulation, one can gauge the response to an external force for individual interatomic interactions and determine structures along the unfolding pathway. In combination, single-molecule force probes and molecular simulations contribute to uncover the rich behavior of proteins when subjected to mechanical force. Scope of review: We focus on how simplified protein models have been instrumental in showing how general properties of the free energy landscape of a protein relate to its response to mechanical perturbations. We discuss the role of simple protein models to explore the complexity of free energy landscapes and highlight important conceptual issues that more chemically accurate models with all-atom representations of proteins and solvent cannot easily address. Major conclusions: Native-centric, coarse-grained models, despite simplifications in chemical detail compared to all-atom models, can reproduce and interpret experimental results. They also highlight instances where the theoretical framework used to interpret single-molecule data is too simple. However, these simple models are not able to reproduce experimental findings where non-native contacts are involved. General significance: Mechanical forces are ubiquitous in the cell and it is increasingly clear that the way a protein responds to mechanical perturbation is important.","[Batchelor, Matthew; Papachristos, Kostas; Stofella, Michele; Yew, Zu Thur; Paci, Emanuele] Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Paci, E (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",e.paci@leeds.ac.uk,,,"BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/I007423/1, BB/S00730X/1]; University of Bologna through the Erasmus+ programme","MB was supported by BBSRC Grant (BB/I007423/1) to Emanuele Paci and Michelle Peckham, and by BBSRC Project Award (BB/S00730X/1) to Emanuele Paci and Richard Bayliss.

NAMD offers scalable performance on petascale parallel supercomputers consisting of hundreds of thousands of cores, as well as on inexpensive commodity clusters commonly found in academic environments. It is written in C++ and leans on Charm++ parallel objects for optimal performance on low-latency architectures. NAMD is a versatile, multipurpose code that gathers state-of-the-art algorithms to carry out simulations in apt thermodynamic ensembles, using the widely popular CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS, and GROMOS biomolecular force fields. Here, we review the main features of NAMD that allow both equilibrium and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with numerical efficiency. We describe the underlying concepts utilized by NAMD and their implementation, most notably for handling long-range electrostatics; controlling the temperature, pressure, and pH; applying external potentials on tailored grids; leveraging massively parallel resources in multiple-copy simulations; and hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical descriptions. We detail the variety of options offered by NAMD for enhanced-sampling simulations aimed at determining free-energy differences of either alchemical or geometrical transformations and outline their applicability to specific problems. Last, we discuss the roadmap for the development of NAMD and our current efforts toward achieving optimal performance on GPU-based architectures, for pushing back the limitations that have prevented biologically realistic billion-atom objects to be fruitfully simulated, and for making large-scale simulations less expensive and easier to set up, run, and analyze.

In the present letter, we confirmed that the regenerations of initial velocities increased the conformational sampling efficiency of PaCS-MD.","[Aida, Hayato] Univ Tsukuba, Masters Program Biol, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050821, Japan; [Shigeta, Yasuteru; Harada, Ryuhei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050821, Japan","Harada, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050821, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Aida, Hayato/AAU-1166-2020; Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Aida, Hayato/0000-0001-6203-9080; Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007",University of Tsukuba Basic Research Support Program Type A,"PaCS-MD was performed using the computational resources of Cygnus provided by the Multidisciplinary Cooperative Research Program in the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Japan.

Non-linear dimensionality reduction methods are likely to be more efficient than linear ones due to the fact that motions of atoms are non-linear. Here we test a popular non-linear t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method on analysis of trajectories of 200 ns alanine dipeptide dynamics and 208 mu s Trp-cage folding and unfolding. Furthermore, we introduce a time-lagged variant of t-SNE in order to focus on rarely occurring transitions in the molecular system. This time-lagged t-SNE efficiently separates states according to distance in time. Using this method it is possible to visualize key states of studied systems (e.g., unfolded and folded protein) as well as possible kinetic traps using a two-dimensional plot. Time-lagged t-SNE is a visualization method and other applications, such as clustering and free energy modeling, must be done with caution.","[Spiwok, Vojtech] Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Kriz, Pavel] Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Math, Prague, Czech Republic","Spiwok, V (corresponding author), Univ Chem & Technol, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Prague, Czech Republic.",spiwokv@vscht.cz,"Spiwok, Vojtech/A-7747-2008","Spiwok, Vojtech/0000-0001-8108-2033; Kriz, Pavel/0000-0001-5773-9541","COST action OpenMultiMed (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic) [CA15120, LTC18074]; Czech Science FoundationGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [19-16857S]; Czech National Infrastructure for Biological Data (ELIXIR CZ, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic) [LM2015047]","This work was funded by COST action OpenMultiMed (CA15120, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic LTC18074), Czech Science Foundation (19-16857S), and Czech National Infrastructure for Biological Data (ELIXIR CZ, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic LM2015047).",,37,0,0,3,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-889X,,FRONT MOL BIOSCI,Front.

IDPs often fold into ordered states upon binding to their physiological interaction partners (a so-called folding-upon-binding process), but it has proven difficult to obtain an atomic-level description of the structural mechanisms by which they do so. Here, we describe in atomic detail the folding-upon-binding mechanism of an IDP segment to its binding partner, as observed in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, we observed over 70 binding and unbinding events between the alpha-helical molecular recognition element (alpha-MoRE) of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (N-TAIL) and the X domain (XD) of the measles virus phosphoprotein complex. We found that folding-upon-binding primarily occurred through induced-folding pathways (in which intermolecular contacts form before or concurrently with the secondary structure of the disordered protein)-an observation supported by previous experiments-and that the transition state ensemble was characterized by formation of just a few key intermolecular contacts and was otherwise highly structurally heterogeneous. We found that when a large amount of helical content was present early in a transition path, N-TAIL, typically unfolded and then refolded after additional intermolecular contacts formed. We also found that, among conformations with similar numbers of intermolecular contacts, those with less helical content had a higher probability of ultimately forming the native complex than conformations with more helical content, which were more likely to unbind. These observations suggest that even after intermolecular contacts have formed, disordered regions can have a kinetic advantage over folded regions in the folding-upon-binding process.","[Robustelli, Paul; Piana, Stefano; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Shaw, DE (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,,,,62,0,0,17,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,1520-5126,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

Even small changes in folding patterns may lead to serious diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's where proteins are folded either too quickly or too slowly. Molecular dynamics (MD) is one of the tools used to understand how proteins fold into native conformations. While it captures sequences of conformations that lead over time to the folded state, limitations in simulation timescales remain problematic. Although many approaches have been suggested to speed up the simulation process using rapid changes in temperature or pressure, we propose a rational approach, Greedy-proximal A* (GPA*), derived from path finding algorithms to explore the supposed shortest path folding pathway from the unfolded to a given folded conformation. We introduce several new protein structure comparison metrics based on the contact map distance to help mitigate the challenges faced by standard metrics. We test our approach on proteins which represent the two main types of secondary structure: (a) the Trp-cage miniprotein construct TCSb (1L2Y) which is a short, fast-folding protein that represents an ahelical secondary structure formed because of a locked tryptophan in the middle, (b) the immunoglobulin binding domain of the streptococcal protein G (1GB1), containing an alpha-helix and several beta-sheets, and (c) the chicken villin subdomain HP-35, N68H protein (1YRF)-one of the fastest folding proteins which forms three alpha-helices. We compare our algorithm to replica-exchange MD and steered MD methods which represent the main algorithms used for accelerating folding proteins with MD. We find that GPA* not only reduces the computational time needed to obtain the folded conformation without adding artificial energy bias but also makes it possible to generate trajectories which contain minimal motions needed for the folding transition.","[Syzonenko, Ivan] Computat Sci PhD Program, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Syzonenko, Ivan; Phillips, Joshua L.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Phillips, Joshua L.] Dept Comp Sci, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA","Syzonenko, I (corresponding author), Computat Sci PhD Program, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.; Syzonenko, I; Phillips, JL (corresponding author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.; Phillips, JL (corresponding author), Dept Comp Sci, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",is2k@mtmail.mtsu.edu; Joshua.Phillips@mtsu.edu,"Phillips, Joshua/AAZ-6380-2020","Phillips, Joshua/0000-0002-4619-6083",,,,69,0,0,7,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9596,1549-960X,,J CHEM INF MODEL,J.

Interestingly, the latter combination not only folds more proteins but also provides a better balance of different secondary structures than the former in the same number of integration time steps.

Well-established enhanced-sampling techniques do exist to obtain the thermodynamic functions for such systems. However, developing methods for obtaining the kinetics of long timescale processes from simulation at atomic detail is comparatively less developed an area. Milestoning and the weighted ensemble (WE) method are two different stratification strategies; both have shown promise for computing long timescales of complex biomolecular processes. Nevertheless, both require a significant investment of computational resources. We have combined WE and milestoning to calculate observables in orders-of-magnitude less central processing unit and wall-clock time. Our weighted ensemble milestoning method (WEM) uses WE simulation to converge the transition probability and first passage times between milestones, followed by the utilization of the theoretical framework of milestoning to extract thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the entire process. We tested our method for a simple one-dimensional double-well potential, for an eleven-dimensional potential energy surface with energy barrier, and on the biomolecular model system alanine dipeptide. We were able to recover the free energy profiles, time correlation functions, and mean first passage times for barrier crossing events at a significantly small computational cost. WEM promises to extend the applicability of molecular dynamics simulation to slow dynamics of large systems that are well beyond the scope of present day brute-force computations.","[Ray, Dhiman; Andricioaei, Ioan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA","Andricioaei, I (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Chem, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",andricio@uci.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI 1404818],"The authors thank Trevor Gokey for his help in generating the scripts for analyzing the WEM results.

The sequence of chignolin is optimized to form a stable pi-turn and thus the native state has a pi-turn from Asp3 to Thr8. On the other hand, the misfolded state adopts an alpha-turn from Asp3 to Gly7. We previously investigated the differences in the stability mechanism of the two states using computational techniques. Our previous detailed energy analysis implied that the native state was stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the side chain atoms of Thr6 and Thr8, and Thr8 was not involved in stabilization of the misfolded state. Thus, we predicted that mutation of Thr8 to a neutral amino acid could stabilize the misfolded structure over the native structure. In the present work, we performed 4 mu s molecular dynamics simulations for 19 mutants of the 8th residue. Among them, the T8I, T8F, T8P, T8N, and T8Y mutants, in which the 8th residue was changed to a neutral residue, formed only the misfolded structure at room temperature. Even at high temperature, for the T8P mutant, the native structure was not observed, as the T8P mutant cannot form the native structure because of steric hindrance caused by the distinctive cyclic structure of proline. Interestingly, the T8P mutant at high temperature hastransandcisconformations in the Gly7-Pro8 sequence, with thetransconformation corresponding to the misfolded state.

In this study, we describe the performance of AWSEM-Suite, an algorithm that incorporates template-based modeling and coevolutionary restraints with a realistic coarse-grained force field, AWSEM. With its roots in neural networks, AWSEM contains both physical and bioinformatical energies that have been optimized using energy landscape theory. AWSEM-Suite participated in CASP13 as a server predictor and generated reliable predictions for most targets. AWSEM-Suite ranked eighth in both the freemodeling category and the hard-to-model category and in one case provided the best submitted prediction. Here we critically discuss the prediction performance of AWSEM-Suite using several examples from different categories in CASP13. Structure prediction tests on these selected targets, two of them being hard-to-model targets, show that AWSEM-Suite can achieve high-resolution structure prediction after incorporating both template guidances and coevolutionary restraints even when homology is weak. For targets with reliable templates (template-easy category), introducing coevolutionary restraints sometimes damages the overall quality of the predictions. Free energy profile analyses demonstrate, however, that the incorporations of both of these evolutionarily informed terms effectively increase the funneling of the landscape toward native-like structures while still allowing sufficient flexibility to correct for discrepancies between the correct target structure and the provided guidance. In contrast to other predictors that are exclusively oriented toward structure prediction, the connection of AWSEM-Suite to a statistical mechanical basis and affiliated molecular dynamics and importance sampling simulations makes it suitable for functional explorations.","[Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Dept Phys, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jin, Shikai; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Jin, Shikai; Chen, Mingchen; Chen, Xun; Bueno, Carlos; Lu, Wei; Schafer, Nicholas P.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Xun] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lu, Wei] Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Dept Phys, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",pwolynes@rice.edu,"; Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Wolynes, Peter/0000-0001-7975-9287; Jin, Shikai/0000-0001-9525-4166; Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174; Chen, Mingchen/0000-0003-3916-7871; Bueno Basurco, Carlos/0000-0001-9494-6128",Center for Theoretical Biological Physics; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1427654]; D.

The variation of the CS of each C-alpha atom along the sequence as a function of the temperature defines a local heat-induced denaturation curve. We demonstrate that these local heat- induced denaturation curves mirror the local protein nativeness defined by the free energy landscape of the local curvature and torsion of the protein main chain described by the C-alpha-C-alpha virtual bonds. Comparison between molecular dynamics simulations and CS data of the gpW protein demonstrates that some local native states defined by the local curvature and torsion of the main chain, mainly located in secondary structures, are coupled to each other whereas others, mainly located in flexible protein segments, are not. Consequently, CS's of some residues are faithful reporters of global protein unfolding, with heat-induced denaturation curves similar to the average global one, whereas other residues remain silent about the protein unfolded state. For the latter, the local deformation of the protein main chain, characterized by its local curvature and torsion, is not cooperatively coupled to global unfolding.","[Scheraga, Harold A.; Maisuradze, Gia G.; Senet, Patrick] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grassein, Paul; Delarue, Patrice; Nicolai, Adrien; Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Neiers, Fabrice] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, INRA, Ctr Sci Gout & Alimentat CSGA, Dijon, France","Maisuradze, GG; Senet, P (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.; Senet, P (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR 6303, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, F-21078 Dijon, France.",gm56@cornell.edu; psenet@u-bourgogne.fr,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM14312]; Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchUnited States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR); Directorate for Engineering of the National Science Foundation, Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Office [FA9550-17-1-0047]; Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUREIPHI [17-EURE-0002]","The calculations were performed by using HPC resources from DSI-CCuB (Centre de Calcul de l'Universite de Bourgogne).

The simulations were performed using both unbiased MD and the Hamiltonian replica exchange (HRE) method. The results show that at low CaCl2 concentration adsorption of Ca2+ ions lead to a significant chain size reduction for both PGA and PASA. With the increase in concentration, the chains sizes partially recover due to electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbed Ca2+ ions. Here, the side chain length becomes important. Due to the longer side chain and its ability to distance the charged groups with adsorbed ions from both each other and the backbone, PGA remains longer in the collapsed state as the CaCl2 concentration is increased. The analysis of the distribution of the mineral ions suggests that both poly(amino acids) should induce the formation of mineral with the same structure of the crystal cell.","[Tolmachev, Dmitry; Lukasheva, Natalia; Karttunen, Mikko] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Macromol Cpds, Bolshoy Pr 31, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Mamistvalov, George] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Phys, St Petersburg 198504, Russia; [Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Karttunen, Mikko] Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Adv Mat & Biomat Res, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Tolmachev, D; Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Macromol Cpds, Bolshoy Pr 31, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.; Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.; Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Appl Math, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.; Karttunen, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Adv Mat & Biomat Res, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.",dm.tolmahev@yandex.ru; luk@imc.macro.ru; mamistvalov.georgii@gmail.com; mkarttu@uwo.ca,"Karttunen, Mikko/G-4531-2010; Tolmachev, Dmitry/P-8765-2015","Karttunen, Mikko/0000-0002-8626-3033; Tolmachev, Dmitry/0000-0002-9699-100X","Russian Science Foundation (RSF)Russian Science Foundation (RSF) [19-73-00283]; Russian Ministry of Education and ScienceMinistry of Education and Science, Russian Federation [14.W03.31.0014]; SharcNet/Compute Canada;  [RFMEFI62117X0016]","The simulation of the poly(amino acids) in CaCl2 solution was performed within the framework of the Project No 19-73-00283 of the Russian Science Foundation (RSF) (performed by D.A.

Here, we demonstrate its application to learn an effective coarse-grained (CG) model from all-atom simulation data in a sample efficient manner. The CG force field is learned by following the thermodynamic consistency principle, here by minimizing the error between the predicted CG force and the all-atom mean force in the CG coordinates. Solving this problem by GDML directly is impossible because coarse-graining requires averaging over many training data points, resulting in impractical memory requirements for storing the kernel matrices. In this work, we propose a data-efficient and memory-saving alternative. Using ensemble learning and stratified sampling, we propose a 2-layer training scheme that enables GDML to learn an effective CG model. We illustrate our method on a simple biomolecular system, alanine dipeptide, by reconstructing the free energy landscape of a CG variant of this molecule. Our novel GDML training scheme yields a smaller free energy error than neural networks when the training set is small, and a comparably high accuracy when the training set is sufficiently large.","[Wang, Jiang; Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wang, Jiang; Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chmiela, Stefan; Mueller, Klaus-Robert] Tech Univ Berlin, Machine Learning Grp, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Mueller, Klaus-Robert] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Mueller, Klaus-Robert] Max Planck Inst Informat, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 14, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 14, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de; cecilia@rice.edu,"Mueller, Klaus-Robert/Y-3547-2019","Mueller, Klaus-Robert/0000-0002-3861-7685; Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358; Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1738990, CHE-1900374, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; MATH + excellence cluster [AA1-6, EF1-2]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 1114/A04]; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERC CoG 772230]; Einstein Foundation Berlin; Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Freie Universitat, Berlin; German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01IS14013A-E, 01IS18025A, 01IS18037A, 01GQ1115, 01GQ0850]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 2046/1, 390685689]; Technology Promotion (IITP) - Korea government [2017-0-00451, 2017-0-01779]; TU Berlin; BASF SE","We thank Eugen Hruska and Feliks Nuske for comments on the manuscript.

Proteins use diverse molecular strategies to achieve stability at high temperature, yet reducing the entropy of unfolding seems required. We investigated five small alpha-proteins and five beta-proteins with known, distinct structures and thermostability (T-m) using multi-seed molecular dynamics simulations at 300, 350, and 400 K. The proteins displayed diverse changes in hydrogen bonding, solvent exposure, and secondary structure with no simple relationship to T-m. Our dynamics were in good agreement with experimental B-factors at 300 K and insensitive to force-field choice. Despite the very distinct structures, the native-state (300 + 350 K) free-energy landscapes (FELs) were significantly broader for the two most thermostable proteins and smallest for the three least stable proteins in both the alpha- and beta-group and with both force fields studied independently (tailed t-test, 95% confidence level). Our results suggest that entropic ensembles stabilize proteins at high temperature due to reduced entropy of unfolding, viz., Delta G = Delta H - T Delta S. Supporting this mechanism, the most thermostable proteins were also the least kinetically stable, consistent with broader FELs, typified by villin headpiece and confirmed by specific comparison to a mesophilic ortholog of Thermus thermophilus apo-pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase. We propose that molecular strategies of protein thermostabilization, although diverse, tend to converge toward highest possible entropy in the native state consistent with the functional requirements. We speculate that this tendency may explain why many proteins are not optimally structured and why molten-globule states resemble native proteins so much.","[Jana, Kalyanashis; Mehra, Rukmankesh; Dehury, Budheswar; Kepp, Kasper P.] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Chem, Bldg 206, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Dehury, Budheswar; Blundell, Tom L.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Biochem, Cambridge, England","Kepp, KP (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Chem, Bldg 206, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",kpj@kemi.dtu.dk,"Kepp, Kasper P/G-1748-2013","Kepp, Kasper P/0000-0002-6754-7348; Jana, Kalyanashis/0000-0001-9792-8195","Natur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsrad [8022-00041B]","Natur og Univers, Det Frie Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: 8022-00041B",,130,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-3585,1097-0134,,PROTEINS,Proteins,SEP,2020,88,9,,,,,1233,1250,,10.1002/prot.25897,,May-20,18,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,MS7XH,WOS:000534094200001,32368818,,,,19/11/2020

Therefore, prevention of the aggregation of folding intermediates is one of the most important problems to overcome. Recently, we studied the origins and prevention of formation of intermediate states with the example of the Formin binding protein 28 (FBP28) WW domain. We demonstrated that the replacement of Leu26 by Asp26 or Trp26 (in similar to 15% of the folding trajectories) can alter the folding scenario from three-state folding, a major folding scenario for the FBP28 WW domain (WT) and its mutants, toward two-state or downhill folding at temperatures below the melting point. Here, for a better understanding of the physics of the formation/elimination of intermediates, (i) the dynamics and energetics of formation of beta-strands in folding, misfolding, and nonfolding trajectories of these mutants (L26D and L26W) is investigated; (ii) the experimental structures of WT, L26D, and L26W are analyzed in terms of a kink (heteroclinic standing wave solution) of a generalized discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We show that the formation of each beta-strand in folding trajectories is accompanied by the emergence of kinks in internal coordinate space as well as a decrease in local free energy. In particular, the decrease in downhill folding trajectory is similar to 7 kcal/mol, while it varies between 31 and 48 kcal/mol for the three-state folding trajectory. The kink analyses of the experimental structures give new insights into formation of intermediates, which may become a useful tool for preventing aggregation.","[Kachlishvili, Khatuna; Maisuradze, Luka; Scheraga, Harold A.; Senet, Patrick; Maisuradze, Gia G.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Korneev, Anatolii; Niemi, Antti J.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys Living Matter, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Maisuradze, Luka] Yale Univ, Biochem Quantitat Biol Biophys & Struct Biol BQBS, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Liu, Jiaojiao; Niemi, Antti J.] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Molochkov, Alexander] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys LiVng Matter, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Senet, Patrick] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Lab Interdisciplinaire Carnot Bourgogne, UMR 6303, CNRS, F-21078 Dijon, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Univ Tours, Lab Math & Phys Theor, Federat Denis Poisson, CNRS,UMR 6083, Parc Grandmt, F-37200 Tours, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Stockholm Univ, NORDITA, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Maisuradze, GG (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",gm56@cornell.edu,"Molochkov, Alexander/A-8594-2014","Molochkov, Alexander/0000-0002-3578-703X",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [0657-2020-0015]; Carl Trygger Foundation; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2018-04411]; COST ActionEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CA17139]; Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUR-EIPHI [17-EURE-0002],"This work was (i) supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and was (ii) carried out within the state assignment of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia (Grant No. 0657-2020-0015); (iii) the work by A.J.N. has been supported by the Carl Trygger Foundation, by the Swedish Research Council under Contract No. 2018-04411, and by COST Action CA17139; (iv) P.S. acknowledges support from the Bourgogne Franche-Comte Graduate School EUR-EIPHI (17-EURE-0002).

To test how force field differences affect predicted polypeptide behavior, we created a mechanically perturbed model of the beta-stranded I91 titin domain based on atomic force spectroscopy data and examined its refolding behavior using six different force fields. We found that different force fields varied significantly in their ability to refold the mechanically perturbed I91 domain. Examination of the perturbed I91 unfolded state revealed that all five Amber force fields oversample a specific region of the Ramachandran plot, thereby creating unfolded state intermediates which are not predicted by the Charmm 22* force field. Simulations of perturbed I91 refolding with Amber FB15 revealed that Amber FB15 destabilizes stable portions of I91, thereby contradicting experimental stability analyses. Finally, inspection of the perturbed I91 unfolded state along with equilibration simulations of the Ac-(AAQAA)(3)-NH2 peptide suggest that high dihedral torsional barriers cause the Amber ff14SB force field to predict higher helical lifetimes relative to other force fields.

There is considerable evidence that under properly optimized conditions these ions preserve solution-like conformations and interactions. However, it is unlikely that these solution-like conformers represent the intrinsic structural preferences of gaseous proteins. In an effort to uncover what such intrinsically preferred conformers might look like, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of gaseous ubiquitin. Our work was inspired by recent gas phase experiments, where highly extended 13+ ubiquitin ions were transformed to compact 3+ species by proton stripping (Laszlo, K. J.; Munger, E. B.; Bush, M. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 9581-9588). Our simulations covered several microseconds and used a mobile-proton algorithm to account for the fact that a H+ in gaseous proteins can migrate between different titratable sites. Proton stripping caused folding of ubiquitin into heterogeneous inside-out structures. The hydrophilic core of these conformers was stabilized by charge- charge and polar interactions, while hydrophobic residues were located on the protein surface. Collision cross sections of these MD structures were in good agreement with experimental results. The inside-out structures generated during gas phase folding are in striking contrast to the solution behavior which is dominated by the hydrophobic effect, i.e., the tendency to bury hydrophobic side chains in the core (instead of exposing them to the surface). We do not dispute that native-like proteins can be transferred into the gas phase as kinetically trapped species. However, those metastable conformers do not represent the intrinsic structural preferences of gaseous proteins.

In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein-protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call DES-Amber, allows for more accurate simulations of protein-protein complexes, while still providing a state-of-the-art description of both ordered and disordered single-chain proteins. Despite the improvements, calculated protein-protein association free energies still appear to deviate substantially from experiment, a result suggesting that more fundamental changes to the force field, such as the explicit treatment of polarization effects, may simultaneously further improve the modeling of single-chain proteins and protein-protein complexes.","[Piana, Stefano; Robustelli, Paul; Tan, Dazhi; Chen, Songela; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA","Piana, S; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,,,,103,5,5,4,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In the past decade, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing simple, efficient, and yet generally applicable polarisable force fields for biomolecular simulations.

One of the problems is how to describe the amount of folded secondary structure in a protein. We extend the use of Estradas' folding degree (Bioinformatics 2002, 18, 697) for the analysis of the evolution of the folding stage during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It is shown that residue contribution to the total folding degree is a predominantly local property, well-defined by the backbone dihedral angles at the given residue, without significant contribution from the backbone conformation of other residues. Moreover, the magnitude of this residue contribution can be quite easily associated with characteristic motifs of secondary protein structures such as the alpha-helix, beta-sheet (hairpin), and so on by means of a Ramachandran-like plot as a function of backbone dihedral angles phi, psi. Additionally, the understanding of the free energy profile associated with the folding process becomes much simpler. Often a 1D profile is sufficient to locate global minima and the corresponding structure for short peptides.","[Sladek, Vladimir] Ctr Glyc, Inst Chem, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia; [Sladek, Vladimir] Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Sladek, V (corresponding author), Ctr Glyc, Inst Chem, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia.; Sladek, V (corresponding author), Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",sladek.vladimir@savba.sk; ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007; Sladek, Vladimir/0000-0001-5332-7558","Research & Development Operational Programme - ERDF [ITMS 26230120002, 26210120002]; Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [VEGA 2/0035/16, VEGA 2/0031/19]; Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA 2/0035/16, VEGA 2/0031/19]; AMED-CREST [JP18gm0910003]","Part of the calculations were performed in the Computing Centre of the Slovak Academy of Sciences using the super-computing infrastructure acquired in project ITMS 26230120002 and 26210120002 (Slovak infrastructure for high-performance computing) supported by the Research & Development Operational Programme funded by the ERDF.

On the other hand, the coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations efficiently accelerate conformational changes in biomolecules but lose atomistic details and accuracy. Here, we propose a novel multiscale simulation method called the adaptively driving multiscale simulation (ADMS)-it efficiently accelerates biomolecular dynamics by adaptively driving virtual CG atoms on the fly while maintaining the atomistic details and focusing on important conformations of the original system with irrelevant conformations rarely sampled. Herein, the adaptive driving is based on the short-time-averaging response of the system (i.e., an approximate free energy surface of the original system), without requiring the construction of the CG force field. We apply the ADMS to two peptides (deca-alanine and Ace-GGPGGG-Nme) and one small protein (HP35) as illustrations. The simulations show that the ADMS not only efficiently captures important conformational states of biomolecules and drives fast interstate transitions but also yields, although it might be in part, reliable protein folding pathways. Remarkably, a similar to 100-ns explicit-solvent ADMS trajectory of HP35 with three CG atoms realizes folding and unfolding repeatedly and captures the important states comparable to those from a 398-mu s standard all-atom MD simulation.","[Wu, Kai; Xiu, Peng] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shun] Chinese Acad Sci, Comp Network Informat Ctr, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wan, Biao] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 1100193, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Xiu, P (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.; Zhou, X (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xiupeng2011@zju.edu.cn; xzhou@ucas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11574310, 11574268, 11932017]; Program of Scientific Research Informatization, CAS [XXH13506-404]","We thank Dr. Chuanbiao Zhang for useful discussions and D.

The molecular weight dependence of the effective surface diffusion coefficient measured for the adsorbed globule suggested that it exhibited mostly a similar globular conformation to that in the bulk solution. Both the displacement and waiting time distributions of the adsorbed globules were found to follow a power-law decay rather than an exponential process, suggesting a broad distribution of binding energies due to the difference in degree of globule deformation. These effects together reflect a character of the viscoelasticity even in a single-chain globule in dilute solutions. Our findings also demonstrate that it is not the single-chain globule but the inter-globule aggregates at high concentration that lead to irreversible adsorption on the surface, which provides novel dynamics and mechanisms of how a thermosensitive polymer adsorbs on the hydrophobic surface above its lower critical solution temperature.","[Cai, Shali; Liu, Jingjing; Tian, Mengting; Wang, Kang; Shen, Lei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Chem Chem Engn & Life Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China","Shen, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Chem Chem Engn & Life Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",leishen@whut.edu.cn,"Cai, ShaLi/AAO-6548-2020","Shen, Lei/0000-0002-0450-1895",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21574051]; Wuhan University of Technology,This work was supported by Grants No. 21574051 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) and the youth talent support program from Wuhan University of Technology.,,60,2,2,11,18,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1744-683X,1744-6848,,SOFT MATTER,Soft Matter,Mar-14,2020,16,10,,,,,2431,2436,,10.1039/c9sm02335f,,,6,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Multidisciplinary; Polymer Science",Chemistry; Materials Science; Physics; Polymer Science,KU3YY,WOS:000519648300018,31942904,,,,19/11/2020

However, the mechanism by which SDS induces protein unfolding and the microstructure of protein-SDS complexes remain largely unknown. Here, we report a detailed account of SDS-induced unfolding of two proteins-I27 domain of titin and beta-amylase-obtained through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Both proteins were found to spontaneously unfold in the presence of SDS at boiling water temperature on the time scale of several microseconds. The protein unfolding was found to occur via two distinct mechanisms in which specific interactions of individual SDS molecules disrupt the protein's secondary structure. In the final state of the unfolding process, the proteins are found to wrap around SDS micelles in a fluid necklace-and-beads configuration, where the number and location of bound micelles changes dynamically. The global conformation of the protein was found to correlate with the number of SDS micelles bound to it, whereas the number of SDS molecules directly bound to the protein was found to define the relaxation time scale of the unfolded protein. Our microscopic characterization of SDS-protein interactions sets the stage for future refinement of SDS-enabled protein characterization methods, including protein fingerprinting and sequencing using a solid-state nanopore.","[Winogradoff, David; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Winogradoff, David; John, Shalini; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Phys Living Cells, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",aksiment@illinois.edu,,"Aksimentiev, Aleksei/0000-0002-6042-8442","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1430124, DMR-1827346]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41-GM104601]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center from the National Institutes of Health [R01-GM116961]","This work was supported via grants from the National Science Foundation (PHY-1430124, DMR-1827346) and the National Institutes of Health (P41-GM104601).

Although the importance of this mechanism is widely acknowledged, very few high-throughput computational methods have been developed to study it. Results: In this paper, we report a computational platform named P(3)Fold that combines statistical and evolutionary information for predicting and analyzing protein folding routes. P(3)Fold uses coarse-grained modeling and efficient combinatorial schemes to predict residue contacts and evaluate the folding routes of a protein sequence within minutes or hours. To facilitate access to this technology, we devise graphical representations and implement an interactive web interface that allows end-users to leverage P(3)Fold predictions. Finally, we use P(3)Fold to conduct large and short scale experiments on the human proteome that reveal the broad conservation and variations of structural intermediates within protein families.","[Becerra, David; Butyaev, Alexander; Waldispuhl, Jerome] McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E9, Canada","Waldispuhl, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ H3A 0E9, Canada.",jeromew@cs.mcgill.ca,,,,,,42,0,0,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1367-4803,1460-2059,,BIOINFORMATICS,Bioinformatics,Mar-01,2020,36,5,,,,,1420,1428,,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz743,,,9,"Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Statistics & Probability",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics,LR4HC,WOS:000535656600014,31584628,,,,19/11/2020

In the field of tertiary oil and gas production, significant experimental effort to identify properties of compressed gas mixtures has been made worldwide. Often expensive and dangerous high-pressure laboratory methods are used. Consequently, it is important to have a reliable simulation approach that allows exploratory and predictive modeling. In this work, experimental surface tension of a CO2 and CH4 mixture at elevated pressures is presented and discussed. The surface tension is an important quantity in several processes, (e.g., for describing multiphase flow). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are utilized to calculate the thermodynamic properties (i.e., surface tension, density, molar fractions, phase diagrams) under process-relevant conditions. MD has the potential to predict the values of these properties and provide insight into the principal behavior of the whole system. In this work, it is shown that the experimentally determined surface tension is appropriately reflected by predictive MD simulations while providing VLE densities and molar compositions of the vapor and liquid phases as additional properties in the same simulation setup.","[Schenk, Martin R.; Koeddermann, Thorsten; Kirschner, Karl N.; Reith, Dirk] Bonn Rhein Sieg Univ Appl Sci, Inst Technol Resource & Energy Efficient Engn TRE, Grantham Allee 20, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany; [Knauer, Sandra] Eurotechnica GmbH, Stuecken 55, D-22941 Bargteheide, Germany","Schenk, MR (corresponding author), Bonn Rhein Sieg Univ Appl Sci, Inst Technol Resource & Energy Efficient Engn TRE, Grantham Allee 20, D-53757 St Augustin, Germany.",martin.r.schenk@gmail.com,"Reith, Dirk/E-4528-2011","Reith, Dirk/0000-0003-1480-6745; Kirschner, Karl/0000-0002-4581-920X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in project SkaSimFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01IH13005E]; BMBFFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Ministry for Culture and Science of Northrhine-Westfalia [13FH156IN6],"This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, funding number 01IH13005E) in project SkaSim.

However, its true potential remains largely untested because relevant timescales are often inaccessible, limited portions of conformation space get sampled, and infrequent events are usually irreproducible. A culprit is the huge informational burden required to iterate integration steps. To address the problem, deep learning is applied to encode the dynamics into a shorthand embodiment retaining only essential topological features of the vector field that steers MD integration. The flow is simplified via an equivalence relation that identifies conformations within basins of attraction in potential energy and encodes the dynamics onto a modulo-basin quotient space where fast motions are averaged out. The quotient space projection enables coverage of realistic timescales while unraveling the underlying dynamic hierarchy. Deep learning is exploited to propagate the simplified trajectory beyond MD-accessible timescales and to reconstruct it at atomistic level. As shown, the quotient-encoding-propagating-decoding scheme generates within a few hours protein folding pathways with experimentally verified outcomes. By contrast, MD computations covering comparable timespans would take over a hundred days on special-purpose supercomputers. Thus, quotient space constitutes a model for hierarchical understanding of MD simulation while enabling access to realistic timescales.","[Fernandez, Ariel] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Res Council, Av Rivadavia 1917, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fernandez, Ariel] INIQUISUR CONICET, Av Alem 1253, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Fernandez, Ariel] AF Innovat, Pharma Consultancy, 4000 Pemberton Court, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA; [Fernandez, Ariel] AF Innovat, Daruma Inst Adv Res, Q7-P18 San Andres de la Sierra, RA-8160 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Fernandez, A (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Natl Res Council, Av Rivadavia 1917, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.; Fernandez, A (corresponding author), INIQUISUR CONICET, Av Alem 1253, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Fernandez, A (corresponding author), AF Innovat, Pharma Consultancy, 4000 Pemberton Court, Winston Salem, NC 27106 USA.; Fernandez, A (corresponding author), AF Innovat, Daruma Inst Adv Res, Q7-P18 San Andres de la Sierra, RA-8160 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",ariel@afinnovation.com,"Fernandez, Ariel/I-7925-2016","Fernandez, Ariel/0000-0002-5102-4294",,,,17,0,0,0,3,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",0003-3804,1521-3889,,ANN PHYS-BERLIN,Ann.

However, traditional MD force fields that are optimized for folded proteins often generate overly compact structures and incorrect characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and protein regions (IDRs), thereby limiting the quantitative insights that can be gained from MD simulations. We introduce the residue-specific protein force field, ff99SBnmr2, which is derived from ff99SBnmr1 by balancing the backbone dihedral angle potentials in a residue-specific manner to quantitatively reproduce dihedral angle distributions from an experimental coil library. The new force field substantially improves the backbone conformational ensembles of disordered proteins, protein regions, and peptides while keeping well-defined protein structures stable and accurate. This balanced new force field should enable a myriad of applications that require quantitative descriptions of IDPs, IDRs, loop dynamics, and folding/unfolding equilibria in the presence and absence of interaction partners.","[Yu, Lei; Li, Da-Wei; Brueschweiler, Rafael] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","Bruschweiler, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bruschweiler.1@osu.edu,"Yu, Lei/AAB-5607-2019; Dawei, Li/F-7233-2010","Dawei, Li/0000-0002-3266-5272; Yu, Lei/0000-0003-0159-1968",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1715505],This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant MCB-1715505 to R.B.).

Here, in order to explore the structure-function-dynamics relationships of Eurasian woodcock chicken and ostrich Mbs we have applied an integrated approach in which spectroscopic and biochemical data have been coupled to computational techniques as structural modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. The primary structure of E. woodcock Mb, reveals the presence of 3 (i.e. Q34H, E44D and V66A) and 10 (i.e. A19T, E27A, V28I, K50T, D53E, G57A, D60E, N81K, S84A and A120S) amino acid substitutions respect to chicken and ostrich Mbs, respectively. Although the high amino acid sequence identity, E. woodcock Mb displays a higher autoxidation rate than chicken and ostrich Mb, despite of a similar melting temperature (T-m similar to 358 K). Yet, the 3D structural models validated by using experimental data indicate that the three Mbs adopt an almost identical three-dimensional structure conserving the typical secondary and tertiary structural organization. Interestingly, dynamics data reveal that the E. woodcock Mb exhibits greater internal motions than either chicken or ostrich Mbs. Overall, our study demonstrates that in Mbs the functional properties are significantly driven by the protein dynamic peculiarities, which in turn depend on the amino acid composition of the region located in proximity of the pathways for the gas ligands.

While general principles that govern the shape of SDSL ESR spectra are known, its precise relationship with protein structure and dynamics is still not fully understood. To address this problem, we designed seven variants of GB1 domain bearing R1 spin label and recorded the corresponding MD trajectories (combined length 180 mu s). The MD data were subsequently used to calculate time evolution of the relevant spin density matrix and thus predict the ESR spectra. The simulated spectra proved to be in good agreement with the experiment. Further analysis confirmed that the spectral shape primarily reflects the degree of steric confinement of the R1 tag and, for the well-folded protein such as GB1, offers little information on local backbone dynamics. The rotameric preferences of R1 side chain are determined by the type of the secondary structure at the attachment site. The rotameric jumps involving dihedral angles chi(1) and chi(2) are sufficiently fast to directly influence the ESR lineshapes. However, the jumps involving multiple dihedral angles tend to occur in (anti)correlated manner, causing smaller-than-expected movements of the R1 proxyl ring. Of interest, ESR spectra of GB1 domain with solvent-exposed spin label can be accurately reproduced by means of Redfield theory. In particular, the asymmetric character of the spectra is attributable to Redfield-type cross-correlations. We envisage that the current MD-based, experimentally validated approach should lead to a more definitive, accurate picture of SDSL ESR experiments.","[Izmailov, Sergei A.; Rabdano, Sevastyan O.; Podkorytov, Ivan S.; Skrynnikov, Nikolai R.] St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Biomol NMR, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Hasanbasri, Zikri; Saxena, Sunil] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Skrynnikov, Nikolai R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Skrynnikov, NR (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Lab Biomol NMR, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.; Skrynnikov, NR (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",nikolai@purdue.edu,"Podkorytov, Ivan S/D-6752-2015; Rabdano, Sevastyan/L-3829-2013; Izmailov, Sergei/R-7002-2016","Podkorytov, Ivan S/0000-0002-5096-1278; Rabdano, Sevastyan/0000-0003-0481-5488; Izmailov, Sergei/0000-0002-1516-7220",RSFRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [15-14-20038]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB 1613007]; St. Petersburg State University [15.61.2221.2013],"We would like to thank S.M.

A promising approach to enhanced sampling of MSMs is to use adaptive methods, in which new MD trajectories are seeded preferentially from previously identified states. Here, we investigate the performance of various MSM estimators applied to reseeding trajectory data, for both a simple 1D free energy landscape and mini-protein folding MSMs ofWWdomain and NTL9(1-39).

This approach may be fruitful, not only for fullerenes but also for general problems of molecular stability and in other applications of conformational chemistry. For the non-chiral C-60, C-384, and the weakly-chiral C-28, C-76 and C-380 (of these, C-380 and C-384 are classed as unspirallable), Schlegel projections are used to show that these fullerenes can all be represented by pairs of spirals counter-propagating in anti-parallel (C2) symmetry. For C-60, the high symmetry is used to construct an analytical approximation for the spherical double-spirals, shown mathematically to be Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using the formalism of Quantitative Geometrical Thermodynamics (QGT). Therefore C-60 is necessarily stable. This MaxEnt stability criterion is general, depending only on the geometry and not the kinematics of the system.

The functional forms that underlie these models have many common elements for the treatment of bonded and nonbonded forces, which are reviewed here. The most widely used force fields to date use a fixed-charge convention in which electronic polarization effects are treated via a mean-field approximation during partial charge assignment. Despite success in modeling folded proteins over many years, the fixed-charge assumption has limitations that cannot necessarily be overcome within their potential energy equations. To overcome these limitations, several force fields have recently been derived that explicitly treat electronic polarization effects with straightforward extensions of the potential energy functions used by nonpolarizable force fields. Here, we review the history of the most popular nonpolarizable force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS, and GROMOS) as well as studies that have validated them and applied them to studies of protein folding and misfolding. Building upon these force fields are more recent polarizable interaction potentials, including fluctuating charge models, POSSIM, AMOEBA, and the classical Drude oscillator. These force fields differ in their implementations but all attempt to model electronic polarization in a computationally tractable manner. Despite their recent emergence in the field of protein folding, several studies have already applied these polarizable models to challenging problems in this domain, including the role of polarization in folding free energies and sequence-specific effects on the stability of alpha-helical structures.","[Lemkul, Justin A.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biochem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Lemkul, JA (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biochem, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",jalemkul@vt.edu,,,,,,152,3,3,2,2,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"125 LONDON WALL, LONDON EC2Y 5AS, ENGLAND",1877-1173,,978-0-12-821137-3; 978-0-12-821135-9,PROG MOL BIOL TRANSL,Prog.

Here, we review and present applications of two increasingly popular methods that allow long-time MD simulations of biomolecular systems that can open a broad spectrum of new studies. A first approach, Markov State Models (MSMs), relies on identifying a set of configuration states in which the system resides sufficiently long to relax and loose the memory of previous transitions, and on using simulations for mapping the underlying complex energy landscape and for extracting accurate thermodynamic and kinetic information. The Markovian independence of the underlying transition probabilities creates the opportunity to increase the sampling efficiency by using sets of appropriately initialized short simulations rather than typically long MD trajectories, which also enhances sampling. This allows MSM-based studies to unveil bio-molecular mechanisms and to estimate free energy barriers with high accuracy, in a manner that is both systematic and relatively automatic, which accounts for their increasing popularity. The second approach presented, Milestoning, targets accurate studies of the ensemble of pathways connecting specific end-states (e.g., reactants and products) in a similarly systematic, accurate and highly automatic manner. Applications presented range from studies of conformational dynamics and binding of amyloid-forming peptides, cell-penetrating peptides and the DFG-flip dynamics in Abl kinase. As highlighted by the increasing number of studies using both methods, we anticipate that they will open new avenues for the investigation of systematic sampling of reactions pathways and mechanisms occurring on longer time scales than currently accessible by purely computational hardware developments.","[Narayan, Brajesh; Yuan, Ye; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin, Ireland; [Narayan, Brajesh; Yuan, Ye; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Inst Discovery, Dublin, Ireland; [Fathizadeh, Arman; Elber, Ron] Univ Texas Austin, Oden Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Elber, Ron] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin, Ireland.; Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Inst Discovery, Dublin, Ireland.",buchete@ucd.ie,,,"Thomas Preston Ph.D. Scholarship Fund; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme NanoinformaTIX [NMBP-14-2018, 814426]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM59796]; Welch grant [F-1896]","B.N. and N.V.B. acknowledge the financial support received from Thomas Preston Ph.D. Scholarship Fund and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme NanoinformaTIX (topic NMBP-14-2018, grant No 814426).

By employing single and double jump folding and unfolding experiments, we demonstrate the presence of an on-pathway intermediate that transiently accumulates during (un)folding. By comparing the kinetics of folding of the wild-type protein to that of a site-directed variant of C-SH2 in which the proline was replaced with an alanine, we demonstrate that this intermediate is dictated by the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerization.

This landscape has the shape of a 12-dimensional funnel with the free energy decreasing monotonically as a function of the native contacts. There are no significant folding barriers. The funnel can be partitioned in five regions, three mainly folded and two unfolded, which behave as Markov states. The slowest relaxation time among these states corresponds to the folding transition. The second slowest time is only twice smaller and corresponds to a transition within the unfolded state. This indicates that the unfolded part of the funnel has a nontrivial shape, which induces a sizable kinetic barrier between disordered states.","[Sormani, Giulia; Laio, Alessandro] SISSA, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Rodriguez, Alex] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Str Costiera 11, I-34151 Trieste, Italy","Laio, A (corresponding author), SISSA, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy.",laio@sissa.it,"LAIO, Alessandro/K-2117-2012","LAIO, Alessandro/0000-0001-9164-7907",,,,30,0,0,1,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled phi/psi parameters using 2D phi/psi conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of similar to 5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.","[Tian, Chuan; Kasavajhala, Koushik; Belfon, Kellon A.

Methods that have been successfully applied to analyze the energetics of globular proteins are not applicable to the fluctuating partially ordered ensembles populated by IDPs. A combined computational experimental strategy is introduced for analyzing the energetic role of individual residues in the free state of IDPs. The approach combines experimental measurements of the binding of wild-type and mutant IDPs to their partners with alchemical free energy calculations of the structured complexes. These data allow quantitative information to be deduced about the free state via a thermodynamic cycle. The approach is validated by the analysis of the effects of mutations upon the binding free energy of the ovomucoid inhibitor third binding domain to its partners and is applied to the C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein, a 125-residue IDP involved in the RNA transcription and replication of measles virus. The analysis reveals significant inter-residue interactions in the unbound IDP and suggests a biological role for them. The work demonstrates that advances in force fields and computational hardware have now led to the point where it is possible to develop methods, which integrate experimental and computational techniques to reveal insights that cannot be studied using either technique alone.","[Zou, Junjie; Simmerling, Carlos; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Zou, Junjie; Simmerling, Carlos; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Simmerling, C; Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.; Simmerling, C; Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",carlos.simmerling@stonybrook.edu; daniel.raleigh@stonybrook.edu,,"simmerling, carlos/0000-0002-7252-4730; raleigh, daniel/0000-0003-3248-7493","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM107104, GM GM078114]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1330259]; NSF Petascale Computational Resource (PRAC) Award from the NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-1036208]; Laufer Center","This work was supported by NIH grants GM107104 to C.S. and GM GM078114 to D.P.R, an NSF grant MCB-1330259 to D.P.R, and an NSF Petascale Computational Resource (PRAC) Award from the NSF (OCI-1036208) to C.S.

The transition states determine the folding kinetics and mechanism but are difficult to observe because of their brief duration. Single-molecule experiments have in recent years begun to characterize transition paths in folding reactions, allowing the microscopic conformational dynamics that occur as a molecule traverses the energy barriers to be probed directly. Here we review single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy measurements of transition-path properties, including the time taken to traverse the paths, the local velocity along them, the path shapes, and the variability within these measurements reflecting differences between individual barrier crossings. We discuss how these measurements have been related to theories of folding as diffusion over an energy landscape to deduce properties such as the diffusion coefficient, and how they are being combined with simulations to obtain enhanced atomistic understanding of folding. The richly detailed information available from transition path measurements holds great promise for improved understanding of microscopic mechanisms in folding.","[Hoffer, Noel Q.; Woodside, Michael T.] Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada","Woodside, MT (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",michael.woodside@ualberta.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR; John Simon Guggenheim Foundation,This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation.,,64,13,13,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1367-5931,1879-0402,,CURR OPIN CHEM BIOL,Curr.

Typically, these interactions are only treated phenomenologically, via pairwise potential terms in classical force fields. Here, we use an explicit quantum-mechanical approach of density-functional tight-binding combined with the many-body dispersion formalism and demonstrate the relevance of many-body van der Waals forces both to protein energetics and to protein-water interactions. In contrast to commonly used pairwise approaches, many-body effects substantially decrease the relative stability of native states in the absence of water. Upon solvation, the protein-water dispersion interaction counteracts this effect and stabilizes native conformations and transition states. These observations arise from the highly delocalized and collective character of the interactions, suggesting a remarkable persistence of electron correlation through aqueous environments and providing the basis for long-range interaction mechanisms in biomolecular systems.","[Stohr, Martin; Tkatchenko, Alexandre] Univ Luxembourg, Phys & Mat Sci Res Unit, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg","Tkatchenko, A (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Phys & Mat Sci Res Unit, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",alexandre.tkatchenko@uni.lu,"Tkatchenko, Alexandre/E-7148-2011","Tkatchenko, Alexandre/0000-0002-1012-4854","Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg (AFR PhD Grant CNDTEC); European Research Council (ERC-CoG Grant BeStMo)","M.S. acknowledges financial support from the Fonds National de la Recherche, Luxembourg (AFR PhD Grant CNDTEC).

To search a broad conformational subspace, nt-PaCS-MD repeats cycles of conformational resampling from relevant initial structures. Generally, the conformational sampling efficiency of nt-PaCS-MD depends on a selection rule for the initial structures. In the original nt-PaCS-MD, the initial structures were selected by referring to structural distributions of protein configurations generated by conformational resampling (multiple short-time MD simulations). However, their structural redundancy among the initial structures was neglected for the cycles of conformational resampling, indicating that similar protein configurations might be frequently specified and resampled in every cycle in the original nt-PaCS-MD. To reduce the possibility of resampling from redundant initial structures, we propose an alternative selection rule that accounts for structural similarity among the initial structures. Specifically, a pairwise root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is defined for all of the initial structures selected for all of the past cycles. Then a set of protein configurations with a larger pairwise RMSD is sequentially specified and resampled in the next cycle, which is regarded to as a history-dependent selection of initial structures by considering a profile of the past specified initial structures. The present scheme, termed extended nt-PaCS-MD, prevents us from resampling a set of redundant protein configurations. To check the conformational sampling efficiency of the extended nt-PaCS-MD, we used a middle-sized protein, T4 lysozyme, in explicit water. Through the assessment, this extended nt-PaCS-MD identified the open-closed transitions of T4 lysozyme more efficiently than the original nt-PaCS-MD.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Sladek, Vladimir] Ctr Glyc, Inst Chem, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia; [Sladek, Vladimir] Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1000004, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.; Sladek, V (corresponding author), Ctr Glyc, Inst Chem, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia.; Sladek, V (corresponding author), Agcy Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Tokyo 1000004, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; sladek.vladimir@savba.sk; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007; Sladek, Vladimir/0000-0001-5332-7558","Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA); Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA 2/0035/16, 2/0031/19]; AMED-CREST [JP18gm0910003]; Research & Development Operational Program - the ERDF [ITMS 26230120002, 26210120002]; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology","This work has been supported by the Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (Projects VEGA 2/0035/16 and 2/0031/19) and AMED-CREST (JP18gm0910003).

Despite their importance and abundance in the proteome, knowledge about the folding properties of SH2 domain is limited. Here we present an extensive mutational analysis (phi value analysis) of the folding pathway of the N-SH2 domain of the Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) protein, a 104 residues domain that presents the classical SH2 domain fold (two alpha-helices flanking a central beta-sheet composed of 3-5 antiparallel beta-strands), with a fundamental role in mediating the interaction of SHP2 with its substrates and triggering key metabolic pathways in the cell. By analysing folding kinetic data we demonstrated that the folding pathway of N-SH2 presents an obligatory on-pathway intermediate that accumulates during the folding reaction. The production of 24 conservative site-directed variants allowed us to perform a phi value analysis, by which we could fully characterize the intermediate and the transition state native-like interactions, providing a detailed quantitative analysis of the folding pathway of N-SH2. Results highlight the presence of a hydrophobic nucleus that stabilizes the intermediate, leading to a higher degree of native-like interactions in the transition state.

Protein slow motions are associated with structural heterogeneity, short-lived and poorly populated conformations, hard to detect individually. In addition, they involve collective motions of many atoms, not easily tracked by simulation and experimental devices. Here we propose a biophysical approach, coupling geometrical nanoconfinement and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), which distinguishes protein conformations by their respective molecular dynamics. In particular, protein-unfolding intermediates, usually poorly populated in macroscopic solutions are detected. The protein dynamics is observed under unusual conditions (sample nanoconfinement and dehydration) highlighting the robustness of protein structure and protein dynamics to a variety of conditions consistent with protein sustainability. The protein dielectric signals evolve with the temperature of thermal treatments indicating sensitivity to atomic and molecular interaction changes triggered by the protein thermal unfolding. As dipole fluctuations depend on both collective large-scale motions and local motions, the approach offers a prospect to track in-depth unfolding events.","[Bourgeat, Laetitia; Lesieur, Claire] Univ Lyon, CNRS, AMPERE, F-69622 Lyon, France; [Bourgeat, Laetitia; Serghei, Anatoli] Univ Lyon, CNRS, IMP, F-69622 Lyon, France; [Lesieur, Claire] ENS Lyon, IXXI, Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, F-69007 Lyon, France","Lesieur, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, AMPERE, F-69622 Lyon, France.; Serghei, A (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, IMP, F-69622 Lyon, France.; Lesieur, C (corresponding author), ENS Lyon, IXXI, Inst Rhonalpin Syst Complexes, F-69007 Lyon, France.",anatoli.serghei@univ-lyon1.fr; claire.lesieur@ens-lyon.fr,,"Lesieur, Claire/0000-0001-9594-014X","Interdisciplinary Mission (MITI, Defi 'Instrumentations aux limites' ATTOGRAM) from CNRS","We would like to thanks David Leitner and Lorenza Pacini for critical reading of the manuscript and the Interdisciplinary Mission (MITI, Defi 'Instrumentations aux limites' ATTOGRAM) from CNRS for supporting the research.",,67,2,2,0,0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,Nov-29,2019,9,,,,,,,,17988,10.1038/s41598-019-54562-8,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JR9NG,WOS:000499942400001,31784681,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

The cumulative results of multiple simulations suggest a common unfolding pathway of beta-LgA, occurred through the stable and meta-stable intermediates (I), in both urea and DMSO. However, the free-energy landscape (FEL) analyses show that the structural transitions of I-states are energetically different. In urea, FEL shows distinct ensemble of intermediates, I1 and I2, separated by the energy barrier of similar to 3.0 kcal mol(-1). Similarly, we find the population of two distinct I1 and I2 states in DMSO, however, the I1 appeared transiently around similar to 30-35 ns and is short-lived. But, the I2 ensemble is observed structurally compact and long-lived (similar to 50-150 ns) as compared to unfolding in urea. Furthermore, the I1 and I2 are separated through a high energy barrier of similar to 6.0 kcal mol(-1).

The predicted network topologies and relative transition time scales agree well with direct estimates from time-dependent molecular dynamics data, stochastic simulations, and phylogenetic trees, respectively.

At the classical level, it is now possible to perform atomistic simulations with systems containing over 10 million atoms and to collect trajectories extending to the millisecond range. Such achievements are moving biosimulations into the mainstream of structural biology research, complementary to the experimental studies.

Understanding of these effects is particularly important for small proteins, for which the dyes, along with their linkers, can be comparable in size (mass) with the protein. Using a coarse-grained model, we simulated folding of BBL protein and two of its FRET constructs. The obtained results suggest that even for small proteins, such as the 45-residue BBL, the appearance of the excluded volume in the protein conformation space due to the presence of dyes does not change the overall picture of folding. At the same time, some deviations from folding of the original protein are observed, in particular, the FRET constructs fold considerably slower than the original protein because the protein collapse in the initial state of folding is slowed down due to the protein loading with relatively massive dyes.","[Chekmarev, Sergei F.] RAS, SB, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), RAS, SB, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.; Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-04-00013],This work was supported by a grant from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (18-04-00013).,,45,0,0,3,8,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0301-4622,1873-4200,,BIOPHYS CHEM,Biophys.

More recently, the inverse problem - designing an amino acid sequence that will fold into a specified three-dimensional structure - has attracted growing attention as a potential route to the rational engineering of proteins with functions useful in biotechnology and medicine. Methods for the prediction and design of protein structures have advanced dramatically in the past decade. Increases in computing power and the rapid growth in protein sequence and structure databases have fuelled the development of new data-intensive and computationally demanding approaches for structure prediction. New algorithms for designing protein folds and protein-protein interfaces have been used to engineer novel high-order assemblies and to design from scratch fluorescent proteins with novel or enhanced properties, as well as signalling proteins with therapeutic potential. In this Review, we describe current approaches for protein structure prediction and design and highlight a selection of the successful applications they have enabled.","[Kuhlman, Brian] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Kuhlman, Brian] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA; [Bradley, Philip] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Kuhlman, B (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.; Kuhlman, B (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.; Bradley, P (corresponding author), Fred Hutchinson Canc Res Ctr, Computat Biol Program, 1124 Columbia St, Seattle, WA 98104 USA.; Bradley, P (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",bkuhlman@email.unc.edu; pbradley@fredhutch.org,,"Kuhlman, Brian/0000-0003-4907-9699; Bradley, Philip/0000-0002-0224-6464","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM117968, R35GM131923, R01GM121487, R01GM123378]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM121487, R01GM117968, R01GM121487, R01GM123378, R01GM121487, R01GM123378, R01GM117968, R35GM131923, R01GM117968, R01GM123378, R01GM117968, R01GM123378, R01GM123378] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors apologize to the scientists whose important work could not be cited in this Review owing to space constraints.

We use molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the effects of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the conformational evolution of monomeric A beta(1-42) peptide. The chirality of CNT varies from (10, 10), (15, 15), (20, 20) and (25, 25) that corresponds to declining curvatures. We show that the adhesion of peptide on CNT surface leads to internal structures predisposes to collapse, which might be reasonable methods to impede the initial nucleation and self-assembly. Adsorption induce the loss of the peptides' native structures. Adsorption and subsequent denaturation accompanies by a loss of surface hydration of peptide. When the curvature of CNT decreases, peptide spread almost completely over the CNT surface. Conversely, peptide will wrap around the CNT when the curvature of CNT is high. Peptide adsorption onto CNT also reduces their alpha-helical content and beta-sheet ratio, indicating that the CNT significantly affect the formation of alpha-helical structures while inducing random coil conformations. The arrangement of peptides on CNT surface relates to the affinity of various amino acids onto CNT. These insights provide useful information for understanding the binding and winding tendency of peptides on carbon nano-structures' surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the sequences of events in terms of secondary structure melting of several proteins in these two solvents have generated diverse results. A clear molecular understanding has still not been drawn to address the differential secondary structure specificity between urea and GdmCl. Here, we present a way to predict the possible unfolding route of alpha/beta proteins, in terms of secondary structure melting, based on the observation of relative solvent exposure of the alphahelix and beta-sheet of protein in water. We find that while beta-sheet always melts first in urea, a diverse preference is evident for GdmCl. Larger solvent exposure of the backbone of the beta-sheet helps the beta-sheet to make favorable hydrogen bonds with urea which in turn causes the initial melting of the beta-sheet of alpha/beta proteins in urea. On the other hand, because GdmCl has hydrophobic weakening ability through preferential interaction, the region which has comparatively more hydrophobic solvent exposure melts first in GdmCl. Urea- and GdmCl-induced initial unfolding pathways of the alpha/beta protein is thus determined by the relative solvent exposure of the alphahelix and beta-sheet of protein in water. Therefore, detailed knowledge of relative solvent exposures in water can provide a hint of the possible unfolding pathway provided the mode of action of the solvent is known.","[Parui, Sridip; Jana, Biman] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Sch Chem Sci, Kolkata 700032, India","Jana, B (corresponding author), Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Sch Chem Sci, Kolkata 700032, India.",pcbj@iacs.res.in,,"Parui, Sridip/0000-0003-0906-963X",Department of Science and Technology SERB [EMR/2016/001333]; CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India,This research is supported by the Department of Science and Technology SERB Grant EMR/2016/001333 for funding.

However, direct experimental observation of heterogeneous folding pathways is difficult. Naturally evolved proteins typically exhibit a smooth folding energy landscape for fast and efficient folding by avoiding unfavorable kinetic traps. In this case, rapid fluctuations between unfolded conformations result in apparent two-state behavior and make different pathways indistinguishable. However, the landscape roughness can be different, depending on the selection pressures during evolution. Here, we characterize the unusually rugged folding energy landscape of human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease monomer using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy. Our data show that fluctuations between unfolded conformations are slow, which enables the experimental observation of heterogeneous folding pathways as predicted by the landscape theory. Although the landscape ruggedness is sensitive to the mutations and fluorophore locations, the folding rate is similar for various protease constructs. The natural evolution of the protease to have a rugged energy landscape likely results from intrinsic pressures to maintain robust folding when human immunodeficiency virus-1 mutates frequently, which is essential for its survival.","[Yoo, Janghyun; Louis, John M.; Chung, Hoi Sung] NIDDK, Lab Chem Phys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Chung, HS (corresponding author), NIDDK, Lab Chem Phys, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",chunghoi@niddk.nih.gov,"Chung, Hoi Sung/C-2624-2009","Chung, Hoi Sung/0000-0001-6897-4969","Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of National Institutes of Health; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075113, ZIADK075113, ZIADK075113] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of National Institutes of Health.,,78,1,1,0,6,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

We present a novel approach, called targeted adversarial learning optimized sampling (TALOS), to modify the potential energy surface in order to drive the system to a user-defined target distribution where the free-energy barrier is lowered. Combining statistical mechanics and generative learning, TALOS formulates a competing game between a sampling engine and a virtual discriminator, enables unsupervised construction of bias potentials, and seeks for an optimal transport plan that transforms the system into a target. Through multiple experiments, we show that on-the fly training of TALOS benefits from the state-of-art optimization techniques in deep learning and thus is efficient, robust, and interpretable. TALOS is also closely connected to the actor-critic reinforcement learning and hence leads to a new way of flexibly manipulating the many-body Hamiltonian systems.","[Zhang, Jun; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Yang, Yi Isaac] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, USI Campus,Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland; [Yang, Yi Isaac] USI, Inst Computat Sci, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland; [Yang, Yi Isaac] Inst Syst Biol, Shenzhen Bay Lab, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Zhang, J; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jun.zhang@fu-berlin.de; frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"; Yang, Yi Isaac/F-3803-2015","Zhang, Jun/0000-0002-8760-6747; Yang, Yi Isaac/0000-0002-5599-0975","Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERC CoG 772230, ERC-2014-ADG-670227]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NCCR MARVEL 51NF40_141828]","The authors thank Michele Parrinello, Yi Qin Gao, Omar Valsson, Giovanni Maria Piccini, and Haiyang Niu for useful discussion.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (hnRNPG) is an m(6)A reader protein that binds RNA through RRM and Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motifs. Here, we show that hnRNPG directly binds to the phosphorylated carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) using RGG motifs in its low-complexity region. Through interactions with the phosphorylated CTD and nascent RNA, hnRNPG associates co-transcriptionally with RNAPII and regulates alternative splicing transcriptome-wide. m(6)A near splice sites in nascent pre-mRNA modulates hnRNPG binding, which influences RNAPII occupancy patterns and promotes exon inclusion. Our results reveal an integrated mechanism of co-transcriptional m(6)A-mediated splicing regulation, in which an m(6)A reader protein uses RGG motifs to co-transcriptionally interact with both RNAPII and m(6)A-modified nascent pre-mRNA to modulate RNAPII occupancy and alternative splicing.","[Zhou, Katherine I.; Matuszek, Zaneta; Pan, Jessica N.; Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zhou, Katherine I.] Univ Chicago, Med Scientist Training Program, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Shi, Hailing; Lyu, Ruitu; He, Chuan] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wylder, Adam C.] Univ Chicago, Dept Mol Genet & Cell Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [He, Chuan] Howard Hughes Med Inst, Chevy Chase, MD USA; [Parisien, Marc] McGill Univ, Dept Dent, Alan Edwards Ctr Res Pain, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G14, Canada; [Pan, Tao] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Pan, T (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Parisien, M (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Dent, Alan Edwards Ctr Res Pain, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G14, Canada.; Pan, T (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",marc.parisien@mcgill.ca; taopan@uchicago.edu,,"Zhou, Katherine/0000-0001-6442-0475; Parisien, Marc/0000-0003-2924-5960; Pan, Jessica/0000-0002-6743-6146","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM113194, RM1HG008935, F30GM120917]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [T32GM007281]; University of Chicago Biological Sciences DivisionUniversity of Chicago; Frank Family Endowment; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935, RM1HG008935] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM007281, T32GM007281, T32GM007281, R01GM113194, R01GM113194, T32GM007281, F30GM120917, R01GM113194, T32GM007281, T32GM007281, F30GM120917, F30GM120917, T32GM007281, R01GM113194] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank all members of the Pan lab and Dr. Jingyi Fei for helpful discussion.

Free I2 is largely unstructured; however, when bound to PP1, three segments adopt a stable structure. In particular, an I2 helix (i-helix) blocks the PP1 active site and inhibits phosphatase activity. I2 phosphorylation in the PP1-I2 complex activates phosphatase activity without I2 dissociation. The I2 Thr74 regulatory phosphorylation site is in an unstructured domain in PP1-I2. PP1-I2 MD demonstrated that I2 phosphorylation promotes early steps of PP1-I2 activation in explicit solvent models. Moreover, phosphorylation-dependent activation occurred in PP1-I2 complexes derived from I2 orthologs with diverse sequences from human, yeast, worm, and protozoa. This system allowed exploration of features of the 73-residue unstructured human I2 domain critical for phosphorylation-dependent activation. These studies revealed that components of I2 unstructured domain are strategically positioned for phosphorylation responsiveness including a transient alpha-helix. There was no evidence that electrostatic interactions of I2 phosphothreonine74 influenced PP1-I2 activation. Instead, phosphorylation altered the conformation of residues around Thr74. Phosphorylation uncurled the distance between I2 residues Glu71 to Tyr76 to promote PP1-I2 activation, whereas reduced distances reduced activation. This I2 residue Glu71 to Tyr76 distance distribution, independently from Thr74 phosphorylation, controls I2 i-helix displacement from the PP1 active site leading to PP1-I2 activation.","[Cannon, John F.] Univ Missouri, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Columbia, MO 65212 USA","Cannon, JF (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Dept Mol Microbiol & Immunol, Columbia, MO 65212 USA.",cannonj@missouri.edu,,"Cannon, John/0000-0001-6698-176X",University of Missouri Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Comet supercomputers through allocation [MCB140208],"The University of Missouri Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology supported this work.

In molecular dynamics simulations, these data-driven collective variables capture the slowest modes of the dynamics and are useful for enhanced sampling and free energy estimation. In this work, we employ SRV coordinates as a feature set for Markov state model (MSM) construction. Compared to the current state-of-the-art, MSMs constructed from SRV coordinates are more robust to the choice of input features, exhibit faster implied time scale convergence, and permit the use of shorter lagtimes to construct higher kinetic resolution models. We apply this methodology to study the folding kinetics and conformational landscape of the Trp-cage miniprotein. Folding and unfolding mean first passage times are in good agreement with the prior literature, and a nine macrostate model is presented. The unfolded ensemble comprises a central kinetic hub with interconversions to several metastable unfolded conformations and which serves as the gateway to the folded ensemble. The folded ensemble comprises the native state, a partially unfolded intermediate loop state, and a previously unreported short-lived intermediate that we were able to resolve due to the high time resolution of the SRV-MSM. We propose SRVs as an excellent candidate for integration into modern MSM construction pipelines.","[Sidky, Hythem; Ferguson, Andrew L.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chen, Wei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Ferguson, AL (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",andrewferguson@uchicago.edu,,"Ferguson, Andrew/0000-0002-8829-9726",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1841805]; Molecular Software Sciences Institute (MolSSI) Software Fellows program (NSF grant) [ACI1547580],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. CHE-1841805.

However, the maximum time step is limited by the smallest oscillation period of the fastest atomic motion, rendering long-time simulations very expensive. To resolve this bottleneck, we propose a supervised parallel-in-timealgorithm for stochastic dynamics (SPASD) to accelerate long-time Lagrangian particle simulations. Our method is inspired by bottom-up coarse-graining projections that yield mean-field hydrodynamic behavior in the continuum limit. Here as an example, we use the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) as the Lagrangian particle simulator that is supervised by its macroscopic counterpart, i.e., the Navier-Stokes simulator. The low-dimensional macroscopic system (here, the Navier-Stokes solver) serves as a predictor to supervise the high-dimensional Lagrangian simulator, in a predictorcorrector type algorithm. The results of the Lagrangian simulation then correct the meanfield prediction and provide the proper microscopic details (e.g., consistent fluctuations, correlations, etc.). The unique feature that setsSPASDapart from other multiscale methods is the use of a low-fidelity macroscopic model as a predictor. The macro-model can be approximate and even inconsistent with the microscale description, butSPASDanticipates the deviation and corrects it internally to recover the true dynamics. We first present the algorithm and analyze its theoretical speedup, and subsequently we present the accuracy and convergence of the algorithm for the time-dependent plane Poiseuille flow, demonstrating thatSPASDconverges exponentially fast over iterations, irrespective of the accuracy of the predictor. Moreover, the fluctuating characteristics of the stochastic dynamics are identical to the unsupervised (serial in time) DPD simulation. We also compare the performance ofSPASDto the conventional spatial decomposition method, which is one of the most parallel-efficient methods for particle simulations. We find that the parallel efficiency ofSPASDand the conventional spatial decomposition method are similar for a small number of computing cores, but for a large number of cores the performance ofSPASDis superior. Furthermore, SPASDcan be used in conjunction with spatial decomposition for enhanced performance. Lastly, we simulate a two-dimensional cavity flow that requires more iterations to converge compared to the Poiseuille flow, and we observe thatSPASDconverges to the correct solution. Although a DPD solver is used to demonstrate the results, SPASD is a general framework and can be readily applied to other Lagrangian approaches including molecular dynamics and Langevin dynamics.

The reduction coordinates are associated with the leading eigenfunctions of the backward Fokker-Planck operator, providing a dynamic meaning for these coordinates. One of the key factors that affect the accuracy of diffusion map embedding is the dynamic measure implemented in the Gaussian kernel. A common practice in diffusion map study of molecular systems is to approximate dynamic proximity with RMSD (root-mean-square deviation). In this paper, we present a hybrid geometry-energy based kernel. Since high energy-barriers may exist between geometrically similar conformations, taking both RMSD and energy difference into account in the kernel can better describe conformational transitions between neighboring conformations and lead to accurate embedding. We applied our diffusion map method to the beta-hairpin of the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G and to Trp-cage. Our results in beta-hairpin show that the diffusion map embedding achieves better results with the hybrid kernel than that with the RMSD-based kernel in terms of free energy landscape characterization and a new correlation measure between the cluster center Euclidean distances in the reduced-dimension space and the reciprocals of the total net flow between these clusters. In addition, our diffusion map analysis of the ultralong molecular dynamics trajectory of Trp-cage has provided a unified view of its folding mechanism. These promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion map approach in the analysis of the dynamics and thermodynamics of molecular systems. The hybrid geometry-energy criterion could be also useful as a general dynamic measure for other purposes.","[Tan, Qingzhe; Duan, Mojie; Li, Minghai; Huo, Shuanghong] Clark Univ, Gustaf H Carlson Sch Chem & Biochem, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Duan, Mojie] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Phys & Math, Key Lab Magnet Resonance Biol Syst, Natl Ctr Magnet Resonance Wuhan,State Key Lab Mag, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Han, Li] Clark Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Li, Minghai] NetBrain Tech Inc, 15 Network Dr, Burlington, MA 01803 USA","Duan, MJ; Huo, SH (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Gustaf H Carlson Sch Chem & Biochem, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.; Duan, MJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Inst Phys & Math, Key Lab Magnet Resonance Biol Syst, Natl Ctr Magnet Resonance Wuhan,State Key Lab Mag, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China.",mjduan@wipm.ac.cn; shuo@clarku.edu,,"Huo, Shuanghong/0000-0002-2196-0858",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RO1-GM088326]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21773298],We thank Dr. David Shaw for making the 208 mu s-trajectory of Trp-cage available for our analysis.

Two different but related techniques, i.e., dimension reduction methods and clustering algorithms, have been developed and applied widely in this field. Here we show that the combination of these techniques enables further improvement of the analyses, especially with very complicated data. Specifically, we present an approach that combines the trajectory mapping (TM) method, which constructs slow collective variables of a time series, with density peak clustering (DPC) [A.

In OFLOOD, rarely occurring states of proteins are detected as sparse conformational distributions (outliers) with a clustering algorithm. The detected outliers are intensively resampled with short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As a set of cycles, OFLOOD repeats selections of outliers and their conformational resampling. Herein, as an essential issue to be tackled to perform OFLOOD efficiently, a selection rule for outliers should be carefully specified. Generally, many outliers are detected from distributions on conformational subspaces with the clustering. Judging from its computational costs, it is unreasonable to select all the detected outliers upon the conformational resampling. Therefore, it is important to consider which outliers should be selected from the sparse distributions when restarting their short-time MD simulations with limited computational costs. In this sense, we investigated the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD by changing the selection rules for outliers. To address the conformational sampling efficiency of OFLOOD depending on its selection rules, outliers to be resampled were selected by focusing their probability occurrences (populations of outliers). As a comparison, a random selection rule for outliers was also considered. Through the present assessment, the random selection of outliers showed the most efficient conformational sampling efficiency compared to the other OFLOOD trials using the biased selection rules, indicating that a variety of outliers should be selected and resampled during the OFLOOD cycles. In conclusion, the random outlier selection rule is the best strategy to perform OFLOOD efficiently.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Initiative on Promotion of Supercomputing for Young or Women Researchers, Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center at Tokyo Institute of Technology","This research was partially supported by the Initiative on Promotion of Supercomputing for Young or Women Researchers, Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo.

It makes use of cyclic resampling from some relevant initial structures to expand the searched conformational subspace. The efficiency of nt-PaCS-MD depends on the selections of these initial structures. They are usually stochastically occurring perturbed structures at which larger conformation transitions are about to happen. Reliable identification of these is the key to using nt-PaCS-MD. Two new parameters, the moving root-mean-square deviation (mRMSD) and the inner products of the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi, are introduced as indicators of conformational outliers in MD trajectories. Both are based on the analysis of a time-localized set of coordinates, overcoming the need for a target structure while still capturing the complexity of the conformational transition. The reference to which the mRMSD relates is the close surrounding of the i-th conformation, often the (i-1)st one. Hence the name time-localized analysis. In this work, we focus on its interplay with nt-PaCS-MD and show that it increases its effectiveness compared to older versions. The target system is the midsized protein T4 lysozyme (in explicit water) on which we demonstrate the open-closed transition without referring to any target configuration. Additionally, we show that the short MD trajectories can be used for the construction of a free energy landscape of the conformational transition based on the Markov state model.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Sladek, Vladimir] Inst Chem, Ctr Glyc, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia; [Sladek, Vladimir] Agency Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000004, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.; Sladek, V (corresponding author), Inst Chem, Ctr Glyc, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84538, Slovakia.; Sladek, V (corresponding author), Agency Med Res & Dev AMED, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1000004, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; sladek.vladimir@savba.sk; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007; Sladek, Vladimir/0000-0001-5332-7558","Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA); Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA2/0035/16]; AMED-CREST [JP18gm0910003]; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Tokyo Institute of Technology","This work has been supported by the Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences (project VEGA2/0035/16) and AMED-CREST #JP18gm0910003.

Then, what are the distinctive characteristics of the landscape of intrinsically disordered proteins, apparently lacking such energetic bias, that nevertheless fold upon binding? Here, we address this fundamental issue through the explicit characterization of the free energy landscape of the paradigmatic pKID-KIX system (pKID, phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain; KIX, kinase interacting domain). This is done based on unguided, fully atomistic, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations with an aggregated simulation time of >30 mu s and on the computation of the free energy that defines the landscape. We find that, while the landscape of pKID before binding is considerably shallower than the one for a protein that autonomously folds, it becomes progressively more funneled as the binding of pKID with KIX proceeds. This explains why pKID is disordered in a free state, and the binding of pKID with KIX is a prerequisite for pKID's folding. In addition, we observe that the key event in completing the pKID-KIX coupled folding and binding is the directed self-assembly where pKID is docked upon the KIX surface to maximize the surface electrostatic complementarity, which, in turn, require pKID to adopt the correct folded structure. This key process shows up as the free energy barrier in the pKID landscape separating the intermediate nonspecific complex state and the specific complex state. The present work not only provides a detailed molecular picture of the coupled folding and binding of pKID but also expands the funneled landscape perspective to intrinsically disordered proteins.","[Chong, Song-Ho; Im, Haeri; Ham, Sihyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Res Inst Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Res Inst Nat Sci, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,Samsung Science and Technology Foundation [SSTF-BA1401-13],This work was supported by the Samsung Science and Technology Foundation under Project SSTF-BA1401-13.,,53,2,2,0,4,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2374-7943,2374-7951,,ACS CENTRAL SCI,ACS Central Sci.,Aug-28,2019,5,8,,,,,1342,1351,,10.1021/acscentsci.9b00200,,,10,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,IY7QZ,WOS:000486591500009,31482116,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Numerous experimental methods have been developed to measure the disorder of all or select residues. In the absence of experimental data, computational methods are often utilized to identify these disordered regions and thus gain a better understanding of both structure and function. Many freely available computational methods have been developed to predict regions of intrinsic disorder from the primary sequence of a protein, including our recently developed Rosetta Residue Disorder. While these methods are very useful, they are only designed to predict intrinsic disorder from the sequence. However, it would be useful to have a method that could also measure intrinsic disorder directly from structure. Such a method might also be used to identify changes in the structure of systems that can transition from folded to unfolded or vice versa, even systems that are not intrinsically disordered. Here we extended the capabilities of Rosetta Residue Disorder to measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates of a single conformation of a protein. As a proof of principle, we show that Residue Disorder can measure the intrinsic disorder from the coordinates with a higher accuracy (69.2%) than when predicted from sequence (65.4%) using a benchmark set of 229 proteins, showing that intrinsic disorder can be measured accurately from single structures over a large range of intrinsic disorder (0-100%). Additionally, we used Residue Disorder to analyze unfolding trajectories of 12 fast-folding, nonintrinsically disordered proteins generated using molecular dynamics (MD), specifically steered MD (SMD), high-temperature MD, and accelerated MD (aMD) as well as long-time scale folding/unfolding trajectories. Using Residue Disorder, a clear correlation between RMSD with respect to the native structure and measured fraction of denatured residues was observed. Finally, we introduced methods to predict folding/unfolding transitions as well as a native-like structure in the absence of a crystal structure from folding/unfolding MD trajectories. Rosetta Residue Disorder is available as an application in the Rosetta software suite with the addition of new capabilities for directly identifying denatured regions and predicting events.","[Seffernick, Justin T.; Kim, Stephanie S.; Lindert, Steffen] Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ren, He] Oberlin Coll, Dept Chem Biochem, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA","Lindert, S (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",lindert.1@osu.edu,"Lindert, Steffen/K-3558-2013","Lindert, Steffen/0000-0002-3976-3473","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R03 AG054904, R01 H1137015]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE 1750666]; Falk Medical Research Trust Catalyst Award; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [R01HL137015, R01HL137015, R01HL137015] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA) [R03AG054904] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors thank D.

In recent years, Markov state models have gained immense popularity for computing state-to-state dynamics from a pool of short MD simulations. However, the assumption that the underlying dynamics on the reduced space is Markovian induces a systematic bias in the model, especially in biomolecular systems with complicated energy landscapes. To address this problem, we have devised a new approach we call quasistationary distribution kinetic Monte Carlo (QSD-KMC) that gives accurate long time state-to-state evolution while retaining the entire time resolution even when the dynamics is highly non-Markovian. The proposed method is a kinetic Monte Carlo approach that takes advantage of two concepts: (i) the quasistationary distribution, the distribution that results when a trajectory remains in one state for a long time (the dephasing time), such that the next escape is Markovian, and (ii) dynamical corrections theory, which properly accounts for the correlated events that occur as a trajectory passes from state to state before it settles again. In practice, this is achieved by specifying, for each escape, the intermediate states and the final state that has resulted from the escape. Implementation of QSD-KMC imposes stricter requirements on the lengths of the trajectories than in a Markov state model approach as the trajectories must be long enough to dephase. However, the QSD-KMC model produces state-to-state trajectories that are statistically indistinguishable from an MD trajectory mapped onto the discrete set of states for an arbitrary choice of state decomposition. Furthermore, the aforementioned concepts can be used to construct a Monte Carlo approach to optimize the state boundaries regardless of the initial choice of states. We demonstrate the QSD-KMC method on two one-dimensional model systems, one of which is a driven nonequilibrium system, and on two well-characterized biomolecular systems.","[Agarwal, Animesh; Hengartner, Nicolas W.; Gnanakaran, S.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA; [Voter, Arthur F.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Div T 1, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA","Gnanakaran, S (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Theoret Biol & Biophys Grp, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA.",gnana@lanl.gov; afv@lanl.gov,,,Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program; National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Energy by the Argonne National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06-CH11357]; Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Los Alamos National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory [DE-AC5206NA25396]; Oak Ridge National LaboratoryUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-00OR22725]; Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research [HHSN261200800001E],"This work has been supported in part by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health.

Therefore, a variety of analysis frameworks have been introduced in order to distill complex motions into lower-dimensional representations that model the system dynamics. These dynamical models have been developed to optimally approximate the system's global kinetics. However, the separate aims of optimizing global kinetics and modeling a process of interest diverge when the process of interest is not the slowest process in the system. Here, we introduce deflation into state-of-the-art methods in molecular kinetics in order to preserve the use of variational optimization tools when the slowest dynamical mode is not the same as the one we seek to model and understand. First, we showcase deflation for a simple toy system and introduce the deflated variational approach to Markov processes (dVAMP). Using dVAMP, we show that nondominant reaction coordinates produced using deflation are more informative than their counterparts generated without deflation. Then, we examine a protein folding system in which the slowest dynamical mode is not folding.

We analyzed and compared the simulation results obtained by these two methods based on several aspects, such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), native contacts, cluster analysis, folding snapshots, free energy landscape, and the evolution of the radius of gyration, which showed that these eight proteins were successfully and consistently folded into the corresponding native structures by AMD simulations carried out at room temperature. In addition, the folding occurred in the range of 40 similar to 180 ns after starting from the linear structures of the eight proteins at 300 K. By contrast, these stable folding structures were not found when the traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used. At the same time, the influence of high temperatures (350, 400, and 450 K) is also further investigated. Study found that the simulation efficiency of AMD is higher than that of MD simulations, regardless of the temperature. Of these temperatures, 300 K is the most suitable temperature for protein folding for all systems. To further investigate the efficiency of AMD, another trajectory was simulated for eight proteins with the same linear structure but different random seeds at 300 K. Both AMD trajectories reached the correct folded structures. Our result clearly shows that AMD simulation are a highly efficient and reliable method for the study of protein folding.","[Duan, Lili; Guo, Xiaona; Feng, Guoqiang; Li, Yuchen] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Cong, Yalong; Zhang, John Z.

Experimental investigations of protein unfolding have been predominately conducted by small temperature perturbations (e.g., temperature jump), while molecular simulations are limited to small time scales (microseconds) and high temperatures to observe unfolding. Thus, it remains unclear how fast a protein unfolds irreversibly and loses function (i.e., inactivation) across a large temperature range. In this work, using nanosecond pulsed heating of individual plasmonic nanoparticles to create precise localized heating, we examine the protein inactivation kinetics at extremely high temperatures. Connecting this with protein inactivation measurements at low temperatures, we observe that the kinetics of protein unfolding is less sensitive to temperature change at the higher temperatures, which significantly departs from the Arrhenius behavior extrapolated from low temperatures. To account for this effect, we propose a reaction-diffusion model that modifies the temperature-dependence of protein inactivation by introducing a diffusion limit. Analysis of the reaction-diffusion model provides general guidelines in the behavior of protein inactivation (reaction-limited, transition, diffusion-limited) across a large temperature range from physiological temperature to extremely high temperatures. We further demonstrate that the reaction-diffusion model is particularly useful for designing optimal operating conditions for protein photoinactivation. The experimentally validated reaction-diffusion kinetics of protein unfolding is an important step toward understanding protein-inactivation kinetics over a large temperature range. It has important applications including molecular hyperthermia and calls for future studies to examine this model for other protein molecules.","[Sarkar, Daipayan; Kang, Peiyuan; Qin, Zhenpeng] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Mech Engn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Nielsen, Steven O.] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Chem & Biochem, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Qin, Zhenpeng] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Bioengn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Qin, Zhenpeng] Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Surg, Dallas, TX 75390 USA","Qin, ZP (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Mech Engn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.; Qin, ZP (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Bioengn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.; Qin, ZP (corresponding author), Univ Texas Southwestern Med Ctr Dallas, Dept Surg, Dallas, TX 75390 USA.",Zhenpeng.Qin@utdallas.edu,"Nielsen, Steven O/G-9339-2012; Qin, Zhenpeng/N-6036-2015","Nielsen, Steven O/0000-0003-3390-3313; Sarkar, Daipayan/0000-0002-4167-2108; Qin, Zhenpeng/0000-0003-3406-3045",Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) [RP180846]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1631910]; University of Texas at Dallas,"This study was partially supported by Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT, RP180846), National Science Foundation (1631910), and startup fund from The University of Texas at Dallas to Z.Q.",,80,2,2,3,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1936-0851,1936-086X,,ACS NANO,ACS Nano,AUG,2019,13,8,,,,,8669,8679,,10.1021/acsnano.9b00068,,,11,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,IV1ZR,WOS:000484077800018,31268674,Green Accepted,,,19/11/2020

We demonstrate that for the case of torchani-ANI-1x NNP, we can parameterize small molecules in a fraction of time compared with an equivalent parameterization using DFT QM calculations while producing more accurate parameters than FF (GAFF2).

To evaluate the accuracy of the latest atomistic explicit-solvent force fields in modeling larger IDPs with nontrivial structural features, we focus on the 61-residue N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of tumor suppressor p53, an important protein in cancer biology that has been extensively studied, and abundant experimental data is available for evaluation of simulated ensembles. We performed extensive replica exchange with solute tempering simulations, in excess of 1.0 mu s/replica, to generate disordered structural ensembles of p53-TAD using six latest explicit solvent protein force fields. Multiple local and long-range structural properties, including chain dimension, residual secondary structures, and transient long-range contacts, were analyzed and compared against available experimental data. The results show that IDPs such as p53-TAD remain highly challenging for atomistic simulations due to conformational complexity and difficulty in achieving adequate convergence. Structural ensembles of p53-TAD generated using various force fields differ significantly from each other. The a99SB-disp force field demonstrates the best agreement with experimental data at all levels and proves to be suitable for simulating unbound p53-TAD and how its conformational properties may be modulated by phosphorylation and other cellular signals or cancer-associated mutations. Feasibility of such detailed structural characterization is a key step toward establishing the sequence-disordered ensemble- function-disease relationship of p53 and other biologically important IDPs.","[Liu, Xiaorong; Chen, Jianhan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Chen, Jianhan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Chen, JH (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Chem, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Chen, JH (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jianhanc@umass.edu,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM114300]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM114300, R01GM114300, R01GM114300, R01GM114300, R01GM114300] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (GM114300).

In contrast to the alpha-helix, the beta-sheet secondary protein structure is significantly stabilized by long-range interactions between the individual beta-strands. It has been observed that quite diverse amino acid sequences can form a very similar small beta-sheet fold, such as in the three-beta-strand WW domain. Employing calibrated quantum-chemical methods, we show herein on two sequentially diverse examples of the WW domain that the internal strain energy is higher in the beta-strands and lower in the loops, while the interaction energy has an opposite trend. Low strain energy computed for peptide sequences in the loop 1 correlates with its postulated early formation in the folding process. The relatively high strain energy within the beta-strands (up to 8 kcal mol(-1) per amino acid residue) is compensated by even higher intramolecular interaction energy (up to 15 kcal mol(-1) per residue). It is shown in a quantitative way that the most conserved residues across the structural family of WW domains have the highest contributions to the intramolecular interaction energy. On the other hand, the residues in the regions with the lowest strain are not conserved. We conclude that the internal interaction energy is the physical quantity tuned by evolution to define the beta-sheet protein fold.","[Culka, Martin; Rulisek, Lubomir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Flemingovo Namesti 2, Prague 16610 6, Czech Republic","Rulisek, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Flemingovo Namesti 2, Prague 16610 6, Czech Republic.",rulisek@uochb.cas.cz,,"Culka, Martin/0000-0002-3944-152X","Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-24155S]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports from Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovations project IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center [LM2015070]","The financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic is gratefully acknowledged (grant 17-24155S).

For comparison, we applied the replica sub-permutation, replica-permutation, and replica-exchange methods to a beta-hairpin mini protein, chignolin, in explicit water. We calculated the transition ratio and number of tunneling events in the parameter space, the number of folding-unfolding events, the autocorrelation function, and the autocorrelation time as measures of sampling efficiency.

Relaxation mode analysis, which approximately extracts slow modes and rates, has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein systems. Previously, we showed that slow modes are suitable for analyzing simulations in which large conformational changes occur. Here, we applied relaxation mode analysis to folding simulations of a designed mutant of protein G, NuG2, to investigate its folding pathways. The folding simulations of NuG2 were previously performed for this mutant with Anton. In the present study, the free energy surfaces were calculated by projecting the coordinates on the axis of the slow relaxation modes obtained from relaxation mode analysis. We classified various characteristic states such as native, nativelike, intermediate, and random states and clarified two main folding pathways. In the early folding process, the first and second beta strands formed an N-terminal beta-sheet. After the early folding process, the fourth beta strand formed along the first beta strand in the same or opposite direction as the native structure; two characteristic intermediate states were identified. Finally, the intermediate structures folded to the native structure in the folding process.

Here, we ask whether such models can be developed systematically from recent advances in bottom-up coarse-graining methods without relying on bioinformatic data (e.g., protein data bank statistics). We use relative entropy coarse-graining to develop a hybrid CG but Go-like CG peptide model, hypothesizing that the landscape of proteinlike folds is encoded by the backbone interactions, while the sidechain interactions define which of these structures globally minimizes the free energy in a unique native fold. To construct a model capable of capturing varied secondary structures, we use a new extended ensemble relative entropy method to coarse-grain based on multiple reference atomistic simulations of short polypeptides with varied alpha and beta character. Subsequently, we assess the CG model as a putative protein backbone forcefield by combining it with sidechain interactions based on native contacts but not incorporating native distances explicitly, unlike standard Gomodels. We test the model's ability to fold a range of proteins and find that it achieves high accuracy (similar to 2 angstrom root mean square deviation resolution for both short sequences and large globular proteins), suggesting the strong role that backbone conformational preferences play in defining the fold landscape. This model can be systematically extended to non-natural amino acids and nonprotein polymers and sets the stage for extensions to non-Gmodels with sequence-specific sidechain interactions.","[Sanyal, Tanmoy; Shell, M.

In this approach, molecules can be extensively sampled and analyzed when they only possess a few metastable states, such as small- to medium-sized proteins. However, this approach breaks down in frustrated systems and in large protein assemblies, where the number of global metastable states may grow exponentially with the system size. To address this problem, we here introduce dynamic graphical models (DGMs) that describe molecules as assemblies of coupled subsystems, akin to how spins interact in the Ising model. The change of each subsystem state is only governed by the states of itself and its neighbors. DGMs require fewer parameters than MSMs or other global state models; in particular, we do not need to observe all global system configurations to characterize them. Therefore, DGMs can predict previously unobserved molecular configurations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that DGMs can faithfully describe molecular thermodynamics and kinetics and predict previously unobserved metastable states for Ising models and protein simulations.","[Olsson, Simon; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Noe, Frank] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Olsson, S; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Phys, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Noe, F (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",simon.olsson@fu-berlin.de; frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019","Olsson, Simon/0000-0002-3927-7897","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation postdoctoral fellowshipAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [CoG 772230]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [TRR186/A12, SFB1114/A04]","We thank Fabian Paul, Hao Wu, Christoph Wehmeyer, Illia Horenko, Moritz Hoffmann, Brooke Husic, Tim Hempel, and Attila Szabo for discussions and comments on drafts of this manuscript.

To explore the unfolded conformations of ubiquitin under different urea concentrations, we performed hybrid Monte Carlo-molecular dynamics simulations (MC-MD) guided by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structural information. Conformational ensembles sampled by the hybrid MC-MD algorithm exhibited typical 3D structures at different urea concentrations. These typical structures suggested that ubiquitin was subjected to a sequential unfolding, where the native contacts between adjacent -sheets at first were disrupted together with the exposure of hydrophobic core, followed by the conversion of remaining -strands and helices into random coils. Ubiquitin in 8 molL(-1) urea is almost a random coil. With the disruption of native structure, urea molecules are enriched at protein hydrated layer to stabilize newly exposed residues. Compared with water, urea molecules prefer to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone of ubiquitin, thus occupying nodes of the hydrogen bonding network that construct the secondary structure of proteins. Meanwhile, we also found that the slow dynamics of urea molecules was almost unchanged while the dynamics of water was accelerated in the hydration shell when more residues were unfolded and exposed. The former was also responsible for the stabilization of unfolded structures.","[Yang, Ke-Cheng; Cui, Feng-Chao; Shi, Ce; Chen, Wen-Duo; Li, Yun-Qi] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Key Lab Synthet Rubber, Changchun 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ke-Cheng] Zhengzhou Univ, Smart City Res Inst, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China","Cui, FC; Li, YQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Key Lab Synthet Rubber, Changchun 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China.",fccui@ciac.ac.cn; yunqi@ciac.ac.cn,"Yang, kecheng/Y-8236-2018","Yang, Kecheng/0000-0001-9664-1395","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21504092, U1832177]; One Hundred Person Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21504092 and U1832177), and One Hundred Person Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Here, we provide a high-resolution description of unfolded states under refolding conditions for the N-terminal domain of the L9 protein (NTL9). We use a combination of time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on multiple pairs of minimally perturbing labels, time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), all-atom simulations, and polymer theory. Upon dilution from high denaturant, the unfolded state undergoes rapid contraction. Although this contraction occurs before the folding transition, the unfolded state remains considerably more expanded than the folded state and accommodates a range of local and nonlocal contacts, including secondary structures and native and nonnative interactions. Paradoxically, despite discernible sequence-specific conformational preferences, the ensemble-averaged properties of unfolded states are consistent with those of canonical random coils, namely polymers in indifferent (theta) solvents. These findings are concordant with theoretical predictions based on coarse-grained models and inferences drawn from single-molecule experiments regarding the sequence-specific scaling behavior of unfolded proteins under folding conditions.","[Peran, Ivan; Carrico, Isaac S.; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Holehouse, Alex S.; Pappu, Rohit V.] Washington Univ, Ctr Sci & Engn Living Syst, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Bilsel, Osman] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Raleigh, Daniel P.] UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 6BT1, England; [Peran, Ivan] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, Dept Struct Biol, Memphis, TN 38105 USA","Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.; Pappu, RV (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Ctr Sci & Engn Living Syst, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.; Bilsel, O (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA.; Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 6BT1, England.",pappu@wustl.edu; osman.bilsel@umassmed.edu; d.raleigh@ucl.ac.uk,,"Bilsel, Osman/0000-0003-0414-3060; Pappu, Rohit/0000-0003-2568-1378; Holehouse, Alex/0000-0002-4155-5729","Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [107927/Z/15/Z]; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [IDBR 1353942, MCB 0721312, MCB-1614766]; Human Frontiers Science ProgramHuman Frontier Science Program [RGP0034/2017]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1330259, MCB 1051344]; DOE Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [9 P41 GM103622]","This work was supported by Wellcome Trust Grant 107927/Z/15/Z (to D.P.R.), the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Grants IDBR 1353942 and MCB 0721312 (to O.B.) and MCB-1614766 (to R.V.P.), and the Human Frontiers Science Program Grant RGP0034/2017 (to R.V.P.).

The measurement of these microscopic events has been posing challenges for experiment and molecular simulation. In this work, we performed enhanced sampling MD simulations for three proteins (NTL9, NuG2b, and CspA) and analyzed minimum free energy paths on multi-dimensional free energy landscapes to explore the underlying folding mechanisms. Consistencies can be seen between the present simulations and the existing experiments as well as other MD simulations. Quantitative analysis reveals the nucleation-condensation folding mechanism indicating the concurrent build-up of secondary and tertiary structures for the three proteins and gives the detailed formation sequence of individual native secondary structure elements. More importantly, nonnative contacts are generally observed among the proteins, creating a nonnative environment to affect the folding of individual secondary structure elements. A general tendency is that the secondary structure element(s) where the maximal nonnative contacts are observed have the largest formation free-energy barrier(s), corresponding to the rate-limiting step(s) of the folding for proteins that follow the nucleation-condensation mechanism. In summary, while native contacts determine the folding mechanism and pathway, non-native contacts play an important role in determining the protein folding thermodynamics by influencing the free energies of individual secondary structure element formation.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.; Shao, Q (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",qshao@simm.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) [U1501501],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21373258), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501.

Due to the lack of experimental data, we analyze all atom molecular dynamics trajectories from the Anton supercomputer, and for clarity, we limit our attention to the peptide plane O atoms and side chain C atoms. We reconstruct their positions using four different approaches. Three of these are the publicly available reconstruction programs Pulchra, Remo, and Scwrl4. The fourth, Statistical Method, builds entirely on the statistical analysis of Protein Data Bank structures. All four methods place the O and C atoms accurately along the Anton trajectories; the Statistical Method gives results that are closest to the Anton data. The results suggest that when a protein moves under physiological conditions, its all atom structures can be reconstructed with high accuracy from the knowledge of the C atom positions. This can help to better understand and improve all atom force fields, and advance reconstruction and refinement methods for reduced protein structures.

The glass transition temperature which increases with decreasing size of the virus is analyzed through the size dependent melting temperature. The melting temperature and catalytic activation energy of spherical virus of particular size increases when it is embedded in glycerol or water due to mismatch of the physical properties at the interface of virus and surrounding medium.

It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time.

The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations.

Along with synthetic progress, theoretical simulations of MOF structures and properties have shown tremendous progress in both accuracy and system size. Further advancements in the field of hierarchically structured MOF materials will allow the optimization of their performance; however, this optimization requires a deep understanding of the different synthesis and processing techniques and an enhanced implementation of material modeling. Such modeling approaches will allow us to select and synthesize the highest-performing structures in a targeted rational manner.

Although the two proteins have overall very similar backbone structures (beta-hairpin-alpha-helix-beta-hairpin), their apparent folding behaviors observed experimentally were remarkably different. LB1 folds in a two-state manner with the single-exponential kinetics, whereas GB1 folds in a more complex manner with an early stage intermediate that may exist on the folding pathway. Here, we used a new method of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the folding mechanisms of GB1 and LB1. With the Lorentzian energy term derived from the native structure, we successfully observed frequent folding and unfolding events in the simulations at a high temperature (414 K for GB1 or 393 K for LB1) for both the proteins. Three and two transition-state structures were predicted for the GB1 and LB1 folding, respectively, at the high temperature. Two of the three transition-state structures of GB1 have a better formed second beta-hairpin. One of the LB1 transition states has a better formed first hairpin, and the other has both hairpins equally formed. The structural features of these transition states are in good agreement with experimental transition-state analysis. At 300 K, more complex folding processes were observed in the simulations for both the proteins. Several intermediate structures were predicted for the two proteins, which led to the conclusion that both the proteins folded through similar mechanisms. However, the intermediate state accumulated in a sufficient amount only in the GB1 folding, which led to the double-exponential feature of its folding kinetics. On the other hand, the LB1 folding kinetics were well fitted by a single-exponential function. These results are fully consistent with those previously observed experimentally.","[Cheng, Qianyi] Univ Memphis, Dept Chem, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Joung, InSuk; Lee, Juyong] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Chem, Chunchon 24341, South Korea; [Kuwajima, Kunihiro] Univ Tokyo, Dept Phys, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Lee, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea; [Cheng, Qianyi; Joung, InSuk; Kuwajima, Kunihiro; Lee, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea","Lee, J (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea.; Lee, J (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, Seoul 02455, South Korea.",jlee@kias.re.kr,,"Lee, Juyong/0000-0003-1174-4358","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2017R1E1A1A01077717]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K07314]",This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2017R1E1A1A01077717) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP16K07314.

However, these calculations are usually computationally expensive, and even significant computing resources may result in a small number of independent estimates spread over many orders of magnitude. Such small-sample, high log-variance data are not readily amenable to analysis using the standard uncertainty (i.e., standard error of the mean) because unphysical negative limits of confidence intervals result. Bootstrapping, a natural alternative guaranteed to yield a confidence interval within the minimum and maximum values, also exhibits a striking systematic bias of the lower confidence limit in log space. As we show, bootstrapping artifactually assigns high probability to improbably low mean values. A second alternative, the Bayesian bootstrap strategy, does not suffer from the same deficit and is more logically consistent with the type of confidence interval desired. The Bayesian bootstrap provides uncertainty intervals that are more reliable than those from the standard bootstrap method but must be used with caution nevertheless. Neither standard nor Bayesian bootstrapping can overcome the intrinsic challenge of underestimating the mean from small-size, high log-variance samples. Our conclusions are based on extensive analysis of model distributions and reanalysis of multiple independent atomistic simulations. Although we only analyze rate constants, similar considerations will apply to related calculations, potentially including highly nonlinear averages like the Jarzynski relation.","[Mostofian, Barmak; Zuckerman, Daniel M.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA","Zuckerman, DM (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",zuckermd@ohsu.edu,,"Zuckerman, Daniel/0000-0001-7662-2031; Mostofian, Barmak/0000-0003-0568-9866","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM115805]; OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We gratefully acknowledge support from the NIH (Grant GM115805) and from the OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine.

Nature's Shortcut is proposed to be the early establishment of a set of nonlocal weak contacts, constituting protein loops that significantly constrain regions of the collapsed disordered protein into a native-like lowresolution fluctuating topology of major sections of the backbone. Nature's establishment of this scaffold of nonlocal contacts is claimed to bypass what would otherwise be a nearly hopeless unaided search for the final three-dimensional structure in proteins longer than , similar to 100 amino acids. To support this main contention of the Feature Article, the loop hypothesis (LH) description of early folding events is experimentally tested with time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer techniques for adenylate kinase, and the data are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions from the sequential collapse model (SCM). The experimentally based LH and the theoretically founded SCM are argued to provide a unified picture of the role of nonlocal contacts as constituting Nature's Shortcut to protein folding. Importantly, the SCM is shown to reliably predict key nonlocal contacts utilizing only primary sequence information. This view on Nature's Shortcut is open to the protein community for further detailed assessment, including its practical consequences, by suitable application of advanced experimental and computational techniques.","[Bergasa-Caceres, Fernando] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Inst Fis Mat Condensada, Canto Blanco 28049, Spain; [Haas, Elisha] Bar Ilan Univ, Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Rabitz, Herschel A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Rabitz, Herschel A.] Princeton Univ, Program Appl & Computat Math, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Bergasa-Caceres, F (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Inst Fis Mat Condensada, Canto Blanco 28049, Spain.",Bergasa@princeton.edu; Elisha.Haas@gmail.com; HRabitz@Princeton.edu,,,"Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [ISF1464/10, I-CORE 1902/12]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IDBR1353942, CHE-1763198]; Research Coordination Network grant from the National Science Foundation [MCB1051344]","This study was supported by grants from the Israel Science Foundation (ISF1464/10 and the I-CORE 1902/12) and NSF IDBR1353942 (to O.B.).

Protein folding involves exploring a protein's configuration space given a fixed sequence, whereas protein design involves searching in sequence space given a particular target structure. For a protein to fold quickly and reliably, its energy landscape must be biased toward the folded ensemble throughout its configuration space and must lack deep kinetic traps that would otherwise frustrate folding. Evolution has designed the sequences of many naturally occurring proteins, through an eons-long process of random mutation and selection, to yield landscapes with a minimal degree of frustration. The task facing humans hoping to design protein sequences that fold into particular structures is to use the available approximate energy functions to sculpt funneled landscapes that work in the laboratory. In this work, we demonstrate how to calculate several localized frustration measures using an all-atom energy function. Specifically, we employ the Rosetta energy function, which has been used successfully to design proteins and which has a natural pairwise decomposition that is suitably solvent-averaged. We calculate these newly developed frustration measures for both a mutated WW domain, FiP35, and a three-helix bundle that was designed completely by humans, Alpha3D. The structure of FiP35 exhibits less localized frustration than that of Alpha3D. A mutation toward the consensus sequence for WW domains in FiP35, which has been shown unexpectedly in experiment to disrupt folding, induces localized frustration by disrupting the hydrophobic core. By performing a limited redesign on the sequence of Alpha3D, we show that some, but not all, mutations that lower the energy also result in decreased frustration. The results suggest that, in addition to being useful for detecting residual frustration in protein structures, optimizing the localized frustration measures presented here may be a useful and automatic means of balancing positive and negative design in protein design tasks.","[Chen, Justin; Schafer, Nicholas P.; Wolynes, Peter G.; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Justin; Wolynes, Peter G.; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Schafer, Nicholas P.; Wolynes, Peter G.; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",cecilia@rice.edu,,"Wolynes, Peter/0000-0001-7975-9287; Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, CHE-1900374, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01-GM44557]; D.

This is due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the effect of nonaqueous environments on protein structure from both experimental and computational perspectives. Because most experimental information about protein structure comes from the Protein Data Bank and is collected from an aqueous solvent environment, modern force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are parameterized against these data. The applicability of such force fields to biomolecules in different environments, including when in contact with surfaces and substrates, must be validated. Here, we present MD folding simulations of a highly charged peptide solvated in water, solvated in a solution of 2:1 t-BuOH/H2O and bound to the surface of a methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM), and compare the structures predicted by these simulations to previously reported circular dichroism spectra. We show quantitative agreement between experiments and simulations of solvent- and surface-induced conformational changes of a positively charged peptide in these three environments. We show further that the surface-bound peptide must fold before chemically reacting with the surface. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-ordered SAM is critical to the folding process. These results will guide further simulations of peptides and proteins in diverse and complex environments.","[Webb, Lauren J.] Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, Dept Chem, 105 East 24th St STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Univ Texas Austin, Inst Cell & Mol Biol, 105 East 24th St STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Webb, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, Dept Chem, 105 East 24th St STOP A5300, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",lwebb@cm.utexas.edu,,"First, Jeremy/0000-0001-8829-280X",NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1807215],This work was funded by the NSF (CHE-1807215).

A selective enhanced sampling of dihedral energy could effectively reflect the influence of dihedral energy settings on protein secondary structure representation, which in turn testifies the availability of the force field in folding simulation. Here, a Dihedral-based Selective Integrated-Tempering-Sampling Molecular Dynamics (D-SITSMD) simulation method is shown to provide a selective enhanced sampling of dihedral energy without introducing large energetic noise. Its capabilities of searching for protein natively folded structure and providing the underlying folding pathway are evaluated through the folding tests of three peptides (chignolin, TC5b, and HP35) with multiple AMBER force fields (FF14SBonlysc, FF99SBildn, or FF03) and the comparison to presented experimental data and REMD simulations. Both above-mentioned capabilities are improved, displaying the potential of D-SITSMD in the studies of in silico protein folding and structure refinement. Additionally, it is commonly observed among the test simulation systems that their folding processes are thermodynamically favorable for non-bonded vdW and electrostatic energies but unfavorable for dihedral energy, such that the folding barrier height correlated with the dihedral energy increase from the unfolded to folded state whereas the unfolding free energy barrier correlated with the combined increase of vdW and electrostatic energies in the unfolding process. It is speculated that the influence of a force field on the folding barrier of a protein is fulfilled mainly through regulating the contribution of dihedral energy to determine the secondary structure formation in the global folding process.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shao, Qiang; Yang, Lijiang] Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, 1st North St, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lijiang] Peking Univ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Lijiang] Peking Univ, Biodynam Opt Imaging Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Weiliang] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Open Studio Druggabil Res Marine Nat Prod, 1 Wenhai Rd, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.; Shao, Q; Yang, LJ (corresponding author), Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci, 1st North St, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China.; Yang, LJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Yang, LJ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Biodynam Opt Imaging Ctr, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",qshao@simm.ac.cn; lijiangy@pku.edu.cn,"Yang, Lijiang/AAS-2662-2020",,National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFA0502301]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) [U1501501],"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2016YFA0502301), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501.

Although the detection of molecular behavior that characterizes systems is an important task in the study of MD, it is typically difficult and depends on human expert knowledge. Therefore, we propose a novel analysis scheme for MD data using deep neural networks. A key aspect of our scheme is the estimation of statistical distances between different ensembles that are probability distributions over the possible states of systems. This allows us to build low-dimensional embeddings of ensembles to visualize differences between systems in a compact metric space. Furthermore, the molecular behavior that contributes to the differences between systems can also be detected using the trained function of deep neural networks. The applicability of our scheme is demonstrated using three types of MD data. Our scheme could be a powerful tool to clarify the underlying physics in the molecular systems.","[Endo, Katsuhiro; Yuhara, Daisuke; Tomobe, Katsufumi; Yasuoka, Kenji] Keio Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan","Yuhara, D; Yasuoka, K (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",daisuke@keio.jp; yasuoka@mech.keio.ac.jp,,"Tomobe, Katsufumi/0000-0002-3663-1870","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as Research and Development of Next-Generation FieldsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","We would like to thank Mr K.

A common approach to go beyond the time- and length-scales accessible with such computationally expensive simulations is the definition of coarse-grained molecular models. Existing coarse-graining approaches define an effective interaction potential to match defined properties of high-resolution models or experimental data. In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce CGnets, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. CGnets maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that CGnets can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, CGnets are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.","[Wang, Jiang; Charron, Nicholas E.; Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Wang, Jiang; Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Olsson, Simon; Wehmeyer, Christoph; Noe, Frank; Clementi, Cecilia] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Perez, Adria; de Fabritiis, Gianni] Univ Pompeu Fabra, PRBB, Computat Sci Lab, C Dr Aiguader 88, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Charron, Nicholas E.; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [de Fabritiis, Gianni] ICREA, Passeig Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain","Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Noe, F; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",frank.nue@fu-berlin.de; cecilia@rice.edu,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019; Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019; Culubret, Adria P.C.

The variational principle has opened the door for a nearly fully automated toolkit for selecting models that predict the long time-scale kinetics from molecular dynamics simulations. However, one yet-unoptimized step of the pipeline involves choosing the features, or collective variables, from which the model should be constructed. In order to build intuitive models, these collective variables are often sought to be interpretable and familiar features, such as torsional angles or contact distances in a protein structure. However, previous approaches for evaluating the chosen features rely on constructing a full MSM, which in turn requires additional hyperparameters to be chosen, and hence leads to a computationally expensive framework. Here, we present a method to optimize the feature choice directly, without requiring the construction of the final kinetic model. We demonstrate our rigorous preprocessing algorithm on a canonical set of 12 fast-folding protein simulations and show that our procedure leads to more efficient model selection.

Although the MTB genome has been extensively explored for two decades, the functions of 27% (1051/3906) of encoded proteins have yet to be determined and these proteins are annotated as hypothetical proteins. Methods: We assigned functions to these hypothetical proteins using SSEalign, a newly designed algorithm utilizing structural information. A set of rigorous criteria was applied to these annotations in order to examine whether they were supported by each parameter. Virulence factors and potential drug targets were also screened among the annotated proteins. Results: For 78% (823/1051) of the hypothetical proteins, we could identify homologs in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium by using SSEalign. Functional classification analysis indicated that 62.2% (512/823) of these annotated proteins were enzymes with catalytic activities and most of these annotations were supported by at least two other independent parameters. A relatively high proportion of transporter was identified in MTB genome, indicating the potential frequent transportation of frequent absorbing essential metabolites and excreting toxic materials in MTB. Twelve virulence factors and ten vaccine candidates were identified within these MTB hypothetical proteins, including two genes (rpoS and pspA) related to stress response to the host immune system. Furthermore, we have identified six novel drug target candidates among our annotated proteins, including Rv0817 and Rv2927c, which could be used for treating MTB infection. Conclusions: Our annotation of the MTB hypothetical proteins will probably serve as a useful dataset for future MTB studies.","[Yang, Zhiyuan] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Life Informat Sci & Instrument Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhiyuan; Zeng, Xi; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biomed Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zhiyuan; Zeng, Xi; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong Bioinformat Ctr, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xi; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Microbial Genom & Prote, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Tsui, SKW (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biomed Sci, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Tsui, SKW (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong Bioinformat Ctr, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kwtsui@cuhk.edu.hk,"Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing/E-4385-2015","Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing/0000-0003-0686-4259","Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [09080302, 11100282, 13120432]","This work was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Reference numbers: 09080302, 11100282 and 13120432) to Stephen Kwok-Wing Tsui.",,44,7,7,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2164,,,BMC GENOMICS,BMC Genomics,May-21,2019,20,,,,,,,,394,10.1186/s12864-019-5746-6,,,10,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity,HZ3XG,WOS:000468781100001,31113361,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Until recently, however, all-atom force fields failed to reproduce these fundamental properties of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Recent improvements by refining against ensemble averaged experimental observables for polypeptides in aqueous solution have addressed deficiencies including secondary structure bias, global conformational properties, and thermodynamic parameters of biophysical reactions such as folding and collapse. To date, studies utilizing these improved all-atom force fields have mostly been limited to a small set of unfolded or disordered proteins. Here, we present data generated for a diverse library of unfolded or proteins using three progressively improved generations of Amber03 force fields, and we explore how global and local properties are affected by each successive change in the force field. We find that the most recent force field refinements significantly improve the agreement of the global properties such as radii of gyration and end-to-end distances with experimental estimates.

Its non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is a key enzyme in viral replication and has been considered as a potential therapeutic target. A conformational characterization of ZIKV NS3 is critical for a comprehensive understanding of its molecular interactions and functions. However, the high conformational flexibility of solution NS3 obstacles the structural characterization of NS3 solely from the experimental observable that averages over its heterogeneous conformations. Here, we employed replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) method to simulate the di-domain protein ZIKV NS3. Three independent MD simulations identified a conserved conformational ensemble of NS3, consisting of a major conformational state and several minor states from compact to loose conformations. The major state agrees well with the scattering profile from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. Moreover, the simulated ensemble is supported by a direct data-fitting result that requires both short- and long-range structural contacts to recover the experimental data. We discussed the interplay between simulation and experiment in ensemble construction of flexible biomolecules and shed light on the physically derived conformational ensembles.

Decades of research have provided crucial basic insights, antiviral medication and moderately successful gene therapy trials. The most infectious particle is, however, not always the most abundant one in a population, questioning the utility of classic ensemble-averaging virology approaches. Indeed, viral replication is often not particularly efficient, prone to errors or containing parallel routes. Here, we review different single-molecule sensitive fluorescence methods that are employed to investigate flaviviruses. In particular, we review how (1) time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (trFRET) was applied to probe dengue envelope conformations; (ii) FRET-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to investigate dengue envelope intrinsic dynamics and (iii) single particle tracking to follow the path of dengue viruses in cells. We also discuss how such methods may be supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a range of spatio-temporal scales, to provide complementary data on the structure and dynamics of flaviviral systems. We describe recent improvements in multiscale MD approaches that allowed the simulation of dengue particle envelopes in near-atomic resolution. We hope this review is an incentive for setting up and applying similar single-molecule studies and combine them with MD simulations to investigate structural dynamics of entire flavivirus particles over the nanosecond-to-millisecond time-scale and follow viruses during infection in cells over milliseconds to minutes.

Refinement approaches can be divided into two main stages: The sampling and scoring stages. Sampling strategies, such as the popular Molecular Dynamics (MD)-based protocols, aim to generate improved 3D models. However, generating 3D models that are closer to the native structure than the initial model remains challenging, as structural deviations from the native basin can be encountered due to force-field inaccuracies. Therefore, different restraint strategies have been applied in order to avoid deviations away from the native structure. For example, the accurate prediction of local errors and/or contacts in the initial models can be used to guide restraints. MD-based protocols, using physics-based force fields and smart restraints, have made significant progress towards a more consistent refinement of 3D models. The scoring stage, including energy functions and Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are also used to discriminate near-native conformations from non-native conformations. Nevertheless, there are often very small differences among generated 3D models in refinement pipelines, which makes model discrimination and selection problematic. For this reason, the identification of the most native-like conformations remains a major challenge.","[Adiyaman, Recep; McGuffin, Liam James] Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England","McGuffin, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Sch Biol Sci, Reading RG6 6AS, Berks, England.",r.adiyaman@pgr.reading.ac.uk; l.j.mcguffin@reading.ac.uk,,,Republic of Turkey Ministry of National EducationMinistry of National Education - Turkey,This research was supported by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of National Education (to R.A.).,,183,4,5,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

Both backbone and side-chain conformational distributions and their coupling were optimized to fit those from a protein coil library. The resulting force fields RSFF1 and RSFF2 have been found to be more accurate than popular protein force fields, in reproducing experimental structural data of various peptides and proteins.

Microscale phenomena are often driven by even smaller scale dynamics, requiring multiscale system definitions to combine these effects. At the smallest scale, large active forces lead to large resultant accelerations, requiring small integration time steps to fully capture the motion and dictating the integration time for the entire model. Multiscale modeling techniques aim to reduce this computational cost, often by separating the system into subsystems or coarse graining to simplify calculations. A multiscale method has been previously shown to greatly reduce the time required to simulate systems in the continuum regime while generating equivalent time histories. This method identifies a portion of the active and dissipative forces that cancel and contribute little to the overall motion. The forces are then scaled to eliminate these noncontributing portions. This work extends that method to include an adaptive scaling method for forces that have large changes in magnitude across the time history. Results show that the adaptive formulation generates time histories similar to those of the unsealed truth model. Computation time reduction is consistent with the existing method.","[Guy, Ashley] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Bowling, Alan] Univ Texas Arlington, Robot Biomech & Dynam Syst Lab, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA","Guy, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",ashley.guy@uta.edu; bowling@uta.edu,,,,,,56,0,0,1,4,ASME,NEW YORK,"TWO PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",1555-1423,1555-1415,,J COMPUT NONLIN DYN,J.

We developed an analysis procedure for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles and used it to demonstrate that even relatively hydrophobic IDPs remain nearly as expanded in water as they are in high denaturant concentrations. In contrast, as demonstrated here, most fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements have indicated that relatively hydrophobic IDPs contract significantly in the absence of denaturant. We use two independent approaches to further explore this controversy. First, using SAXS we show that fluorophores employed in FRET can contribute to the observed discrepancy. Specifically, we find that addition of Alexa-488 to a normally expanded IDP causes contraction by an additional 15%, a value in reasonable accord with the contraction reported in FRET-based studies. Second, using our simulations and analysis procedure to accurately extract both the radius of gyration (Rg) and end-to-end distance (Ree) from SAXS profiles, we tested the recent suggestion that FRET and SAXS results can be reconciled if the Rg and Ree are uncoupled (i.e., no longer simply proportional), in contrast to the case for random walk homopolymers. We find, however, that even for unfolded proteins, these two measures of unfolded state dimensions remain proportional. Together, these results suggest that improved analysis procedures and a correction for significant, fluorophore-driven interactions are sufficient to reconcile prior SAXS and FRET studies, thus providing a unified picture of the nature of unfolded polypeptide chains in the absence of denaturant.","[Riback, Joshua A.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bowman, Micayla A.; Clark, Patricia L.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Zmyslowski, Adam M.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Plaxco, Kevin W.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Clark, PL (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biochem, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.; Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",pclark1@nd.edu; trsosnic@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018; Plaxco, Kevin/O-1793-2013","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599; Riback, Joshua/0000-0002-1516-4484; Plaxco, Kevin/0000-0003-4772-8771; Clark, Patricia/0000-0001-5462-8248","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM055694, GM130122, 2P41RR008630-18, 9 P41 GM103622-18]; W.

Although the variance among atomistic WE folding runs is significant, multiple independent runs are used to reduce and quantify statistical uncertainty. Folding times are estimated directly from WE probability flux and from history-augmented Markov analysis of the WE data. Three systems were examined: NTL9 at low solvent viscosity (yielding tau(f) = 0.8-9 mu s), NTL9 at water-like viscosity (tau(f) = 0.2-2 ms), and Protein G at low viscosity (tau(f) = 3-200 ms). In all cases, the folding time, uncertainty, and ensemble properties could be estimated from WE simulation; for Protein G, this characterization required significantly less overall computing than would be required to observe a single folding event with conventional MD simulations. Our results suggest that the use and calibration of force fields and solvent models for precise estimation of kinetic quantities is becoming feasible.","[Adhikari, Upendra; Mostofian, Barmak; Copperman, Jeremy; Zuckerman, Daniel M.] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA; [Petersen, Andrew A.] North Carolina State Univ, NCSU Data Sci Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","Zuckerman, DM (corresponding author), Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Portland, OR 97239 USA.",zuckermd@ohsu.edu,"Mostofian, Barmak/V-5503-2019","Mostofian, Barmak/0000-0003-0568-9866","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM115805]; OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We gratefully acknowledge support from the NIH (Grant No. GM115805) and from the OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine.

Because extricating these two factors is usually unfeasible, it has been common to assume a constant prefactor and assign all rate variability to the barrier. However, theory and simulations postulate a protein-specific prefactor that contains key mechanistic information. Here, we exploit the special properties of fast-folding proteins to experimentally resolve the folding rate prefactor and investigate how much it varies among structural homologs. We measure the ultrafast (un)folding kinetics of five natural WW domains using nanosecond laser-induced temperature jumps. All five WW domains fold in microseconds, but with a 10-fold difference between fastest and slowest. Interestingly, they all produce biphasic kinetics in which the slower phase corresponds to reequilibration over the small barrier (<3 RI) and the faster phase to the downhill relaxation of the minor population residing at the barrier top [transition state ensemble (TSE)]. The fast rate recapitulates the 10-fold range, demonstrating that the folding speed limit of even the simplest all-beta fold strongly depends on the amino acid sequence. Given this fold's simplicity, the most plausible source for such prefactor differences is the presence of nonnative interactions that stabilize the TSE but need to break up before folding resumes. Our results confirm long-standing theoretical predictions and bring into focus the rate prefactor as an essential element for understanding the mechanisms of folding.","[Szczepaniak, Malwina; Cerminara, Michele; Sanchez de Medina, Celia; Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Iglesias-Bexiga, Manuel; Martinez, Jose C.; Luque, Irene] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Quim Fis, Granada 18071, Spain; [Iglesias-Bexiga, Manuel; Martinez, Jose C.; Luque, Irene] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Inst Biotecnol, Granada 18071, Spain; [Cerminara, Michele; Sadqi, Mourad; Sanchez de Medina, Celia; Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Sadqi, Mourad; Munoz, Victor] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, Dept Bioengn, Merced, CA USA; [Sadqi, Mourad; Munoz, Victor] Univ Calif Merced, Ctr Cellular & Biomol Machines, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Munoz, Victor] Inst Madrileno Estudios Avanzados Nanociencia, Nanobiosyst Programme, Madrid 28049, Spain","Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Invest Biol, Madrid 28040, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Ctr Nacl Biotecnol, Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, Dept Bioengn, Merced, CA USA.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Ctr Cellular & Biomol Machines, Merced, CA 95343 USA.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Inst Madrileno Estudios Avanzados Nanociencia, Nanobiosyst Programme, Madrid 28049, Spain.",vmunoz3@ucmerced.edu,"Sadqi, Mourad/J-3180-2018; Martinez, Jose C/J-8721-2012; luque, irene/K-4758-2012","Sadqi, Mourad/0000-0003-3553-3408; Szczepaniak, Malwina/0000-0002-1230-9190; Martinez, Jose C/0000-0003-2657-2456; luque, irene/0000-0003-2757-4779","European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-ADG-323059]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-MCB-1616759]; W.M.

As an efficient low-rank MC method, scaled alternating steepest descent (ScaledASD) algorithm has been used in image processing successfully, which inspired us to apply it into protein structure calculation. To this end, we established the corresponding initial distance matrix according to the characteristics of proteins, experimental NMR data, and the triangle inequality estimation. After obtaining a raw structure by ScaledASD, we added several postprocedures, including chirality refinement, distance lower (upper) bound refinement, and water refinement to improve the accuracy of the structures. To evaluate our results, we compared the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), template modeling score (TM-score), Ramachandran plot, and secondary structure with reference structures deposited from Protein Data Bank. We conclude that our method is consistent with the popularly used methods, which illustrates ScaledASD is a promising algorithm for protein structure calculation.","[Li, Zhicheng; Li, Shijian; Wei, Xian; Zhao, Qing] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Quantum Technol Res, Sch Phys, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Zhao, Q (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Quantum Technol Res, Sch Phys, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",qzhaoyuping@bit.edu.cn,"Li, Shijian/AAH-7273-2020",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11675014]; Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2013YQ030595-3]",The authors thank Prof. Ge Molin and Dr. Xubiao Peng for valuable discussions and Prof. Deng Rongping for reading the article and improving English.

Frequent calculation of some complex collective variables may slow down the simulation or analysis of trajectories. Moreover, many collective variables cannot be explicitly calculated for newly sampled structures. In order to address this problem, we developed a new package called anncolvar. This package makes it possible to build and train an artificial neural network model that approximates a collective variable. It can be used to generate an input for the open-source enhanced sampling simulation PLUMED package, so the collective variable can be monitored and biased by methods available in this program. The computational efficiency and the accuracy of anncolvar are demonstrated on selected molecular systems (cyclooctane derivative, Trp-cage miniprotein) and selected collective variables (Isomap, molecular surface area).","[Trapl, Dalibor; Horvacanin, Izabela; Mareska, Vaclav; Spiwok, Vojtech] Univ Chem & Technol Prague, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Horvacanin, Izabela] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Zagreb, Croatia; [Ozcelik, Furkan; Unal, Gozde] Istanbul Tech Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Istanbul, Turkey","Spiwok, V (corresponding author), Univ Chem & Technol Prague, Dept Biochem & Microbiol, Prague, Czech Republic.",spiwokv@vscht.cz,"Spiwok, Vojtech/A-7747-2008; Unal, Gozde/A-2360-2013; Trapl, Dalibor/AAB-3522-2019","Spiwok, Vojtech/0000-0001-8108-2033; Unal, Gozde/0000-0001-5942-8966; Trapl, Dalibor/0000-0002-3435-5841","COST action OpenMultiMedEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [CA15120, LTC18074]; specific university research (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic) [21-SVV/2019]; Czech National Infrastructure for Biological Data (ELIXIR CZ, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic) [LM2015047]; CESNET under the program Projects of Large Research, Development, and Innovations Infrastructures [LM2015042]; CERIT Scientific Cloud under the program Projects of Large Research, Development, and Innovations Infrastructures [LM2015085]","This work was funded by COST action OpenMultiMed (CA15120, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic LTC18074), specific university research (Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic 21-SVV/2019) and Czech National Infrastructure for Biological Data (ELIXIR CZ, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic LM2015047).

However, experiments are very demanding and difficult to perform, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations can still not provide all the answers. This motivates us to analyze protein dynamics in terms of different reduced coordinate representations. We then need to resolve how to reconstruct the full all-atom dynamics from its coarse grained approximation. Accordingly we scrutinize all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories in terms of crystallographic Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures, and inquire to what extent is it possible to predict the dynamics of side chain C beta atoms in terms of the static properties of backbone Ca and O atoms. Here we find that simulated C beta dynamics at near physiological conditions can be reconstructed with very high precision, using the knowledge of the crystallographic backbone Ca and O positions. The precision we can reach with our PDB-based Statistical Method reconstruction exceeds that of popular all-atom reconstruction methods such as Remo and Pulchra, and is fully comparable with the precision of the highly elaborate Scwrl4 all-atom reconstruction method that we have enhanced with the knowledge of the backbone Ca and O atom positions. We then conclude that in a dynamical protein that moves around at physiological conditions, the relative positions of its C beta atoms with respect to the backbone Ca and O atoms, deviate very little from their relative positions in static crystallographic PDB structures. This proposes that the dynamics of a biologically active protein could remain subject to very similar, stringent stereochemical constraints that dictate the structure of a folded crystallographic protein. Thus, our results provide a strong impetus to the development of coarse grained techniques that are based on reduced coordinate representations.","[Hou, Yanzhen; Liu, Jiaojiao; He, Jianfeng; Peng, Xubiao; Niemi, Antti J.] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Peng, Xubiao] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Quantum Technol Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Niemi, Antti J.] Univ Tours, Federat Denis Poisson, CNRS, Lab Math & Phys Theor,UMR 6083, F-37200 Tours, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Stockholm Univ, NORDITA, Roslagstullsbacken 23, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Niemi, Antti J.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys Living Matter, Sukhanova 8, Vladivostok 690950, Russia","Niemi, AJ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Niemi, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Tours, Federat Denis Poisson, CNRS, Lab Math & Phys Theor,UMR 6083, F-37200 Tours, France.; Niemi, AJ (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, NORDITA, Roslagstullsbacken 23, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.; Niemi, AJ (corresponding author), Far Eastern Fed Univ, Lab Phys Living Matter, Sukhanova 8, Vladivostok 690950, Russia.",Antti.Niemi@su.se,"Peng, Xubiao/AAF-2371-2019","Peng, Xubiao/0000-0002-6494-9560; Niemi, Antti/0000-0003-3408-5834",Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2018-04411]; VetenskapsradetSwedish Research Council; Carl Trygger's Stiftelse for vetenskaplig forskning,The research of A.J.

Unlike traditional proteins that adopt a definitive structure, IDPs in free solution are disordered and exist as an ensemble of conformations. This enables the IDPs to signal through multiple signaling pathways and serve as scaffolds for multi-protein complexes. The challenge in studying IDPs experimentally stems from their disordered nature. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism, small angle X-ray scattering, and single molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can give the local structural information and overall dimension of IDPs, but seldom provide a unified picture of the whole protein. To understand the conformational dynamics of IDPs and how their structural ensembles recognize multiple binding partners and small molecule inhibitors, knowledge-based and physics-based sampling techniques are utilized in-silico, guided by experimental structural data. However, efficient sampling of the IDP conformational ensemble requires traversing the numerous degrees of freedom in the IDP energy landscape, as well as force-fields that accurately model the protein and solvent interactions. In this review, we have provided an overview of the current state of computational methods for studying IDP structure and dynamics and discussed the major challenges faced in this field.","[Bhattacharya, Supriyo] City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Beckman Res Inst, Div Res Informat, Duarte, CA 91010 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Bhattacharya, S (corresponding author), City Hope Natl Med Ctr, Beckman Res Inst, Div Res Informat, Duarte, CA 91010 USA.",sbhattach@coh.org; xclin@mit.edu,"Bhattacharya, Supriyo/AAO-8552-2020; Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Bhattacharya, Supriyo/0000-0003-0483-2149; Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174","National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA033572]; National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Center for Theoretical Biological PhysicsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-PHY-1427654, NSF MCB-1241332, NSF-CHE-1614101]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572, P30CA033572] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Research reported in this publication included work performed in the Computational Therapeutics Core supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number P30CA033572.

We demonstrate that OPC, together with a popular AMBER force field ff99SB, offers a noticeable improvement over TIP3P in producing more realistic structural ensembles of three common IDPs benchmarks: 55-residue apo N-terminal zinc-binding domain of HIV-1 integrase (protein IN), amyloid beta-peptide (A beta(42)) (residues 1-42), and 26-reside H4 histone tail. As a negative control, computed folding profile of a regular globular miniprotein (CLN025) in OPC water is in appreciably better agreement with experiment than that obtained in TIP3P, which tends to overstabilize the compact native state relative to the extended conformations. We employed A beta(4)(2) peptide to investigate the possible influence of the solvent box size on simulation outcomes. We advocate a cautious approach for simulations of IDPs: we suggest that the solvent box size should be at least four times the radius of gyration of the random coil corresponding to the IDP. The computed free energy landscape of protein IN in OPC resembles a shallow tub - conformations with substantially different degrees of compactness that are within 2 k(B) T of each other. Conformations with very different secondary structure content coexist within 1 k(B) T of the global free energy minimum. States with higher free energy tend to have less secondary structure. Computed low helical content of the protein has virtually no correlation with its degree of compactness, which calls into question the possibility of using the helicity as a metric for assessing performance of water models for IDPs, when the helicity is low. Predicted radius of gyration (R-g) of H4 histone tail in OPC water falls in-between that of a typical globular protein and a fully denatured protein of the same size; the predicted R g is consistent with two independent predictions. In contrast, H4 tail in TIP3P water is as compact as the corresponding globular protein. The computed free energy landscape of H4 tail in OPC is relatively flat over a significant range of compactness, which, we argue, is consistent with its biological function as facilitator of internucleosome interactions.","[Shabane, Parviz Seifpanahi] Virginia Tech, Dept Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Izadi, Saeed] Genentech Inc, Early Stage Pharmaceut Dev, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.; Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",alexey@cs.vt.edu,,,,,,103,14,14,7,32,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

The lack of structural information for proteins hinders the understanding of their function. Here, a data-driven accelerated (DA2) sampling method is proposed, which is capable of searching new functional states of protein from a known structure with high efficiency. The key function of DA2 sampling is to drive the conformational change of protein along its intrinsic motion without introducing biased potential/force, where principle component analysis is applied on-the-fly to reduce the highly redundant information generated by molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, the capacity and accuracy of DA2 sampling are validated by using alanine dipeptide. This protocol is then applied to search for the dosed state of N-terminal calmodulin (nCaM) from the open one. The identified structure resembles the crystal structure of nCaM in its dosed state, with a root-mean-square deviation between the two of only 1.8 angstrom. Interestingly, independent DA2 samplings disclose different open-to-dosed transition pathways for nCaM, which is likely to have implications for its biological functions. Therefore, DA2 sampling is expected to play important roles in exploring functional states of a broad spectrum of proteins at atomic level that are not easily determined experimentally.","[Zhu, Qiang; Ma, Jing] Nanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Sch Chem & Chem Engn,Key Lab Mesoscop Chem, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qiang; Yuan, Yigao; Dong, Hao] Nanjing Univ, Kuang Yaming Honors Sch, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Ma, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Minist Educ, Inst Theoret & Computat Chem, Sch Chem & Chem Engn,Key Lab Mesoscop Chem, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Dong, H (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Kuang Yaming Honors Sch, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",majing@nju.edu.cn; donghao@nju.edu.cn,"Ma, Jing/K-3359-2013","Ma, Jing/0000-0001-5848-9775","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0702600, 2017YFB0702601]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21503107, 21773115, 21873045, 21833002]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [SBK2015041570]; Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [021514380012, 021514380014]","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB0702600, 2017YFB0702601), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21503107, 21773115, 21873045 and 21833002), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. SBK2015041570), the Jiangsu Specially-Appointed Professor program, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Nos. 021514380012 and 021514380014).

Compared to other Fox proteins, they can form domain-swapped dimers through their DNA-binding -forkhead- domains, enabling spatial reorganization of distant chromosome elements by tethering two DNA molecules together. Yet, domain swapping stability and DNA binding affinity varies between different FoxP proteins. Experimental evidence suggests that the protonation state of a histidine residue conserved in all Fox proteins is responsible for pH-dependent modulation of these interactions. Here, we explore the consequences of the protonation state of another histidine (H59), only conserved within FoxM/O/P subfamilies, on folding and dimerization of the forkhead domain of human FoxP1. Dimer dissociation kinetics and equilibrium unfolding experiments demonstrate that protonation of H59 leads to destabilization of the domain-swapped dimer due to an increase in free energy difference between the monomeric and transition states. This pH-dependence is abolished when H59 is mutated to alanine. Furthermore, anisotropy measurements and molecular dynamics evidence that H59 has a direct impact in the local stability of helix H3. Altogether, our results highlight the relevance of H59 in domain swapping and folding stability of FoxP1.","[Medina, Exequiel; Villalobos, Pablo; Conuecar, Ricardo; Babul, Jorge] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Las Palmeras 3425,Casilla 653, Santiago 7800003, Chile; [Ramirez-Sarmiento, Cesar A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Ramirez-Sarmiento, Cesar A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile; [Ramirez-Sarmiento, Cesar A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Biol Sci, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile","Babul, J (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Las Palmeras 3425,Casilla 653, Santiago 7800003, Chile.; Ramirez-Sarmiento, CA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Inst Biol & Med Engn, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.; Ramirez-Sarmiento, CA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Med, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.; Ramirez-Sarmiento, CA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Biol Sci, Av Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, Chile.",cesar.ramirez@uc.cl; jbabul@uchile.cl,,"Medina, Exequiel/0000-0002-1040-6720","Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1170701, 11140601]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT) [21151101]; supercomputing infrastructure of the NLHPC [ECM-02]",This work was supported by Fondo de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT grant No 1170701 and 11140601).

The alpha ->beta transition is a molecular hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, beta-LgA may serve as a good model for understanding molecular mechanism of protein aggregation involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we studied the conformational dynamics of beta-LgA in 6 M GdmCl at different temperatures using MD simulations. Structural order parameters such as RMSD, R-g, SASA, native contacts (Q), hydrophobic distal-matrix and free-energy landscape (FEL) were used to investigate the conformational transitions. Our results show that GdmCl destabilizes secondary and tertiary structure of beta-LgA by weakening the hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond network. Multidimensional FEL shows the presence of different unfolding intermediates at 400 K. I1 is long-lived intermediate which has mostly intact native secondary structure, but loose tertiary structure. I2 is structurally compact intermediate formed after the partial loss of secondary structure. The transiently and infrequently buried evolution of W19 shows that intermediate conformational ensembles are structurally heterogeneous. We observed that the intermediate conformations are largely stabilized by non-native H-bonds.

Kauzmann's hydrophobic interaction hypothesis, which considers hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar groups as the dominant factor, has been widely accepted for about sixty years and attracted many scientists. The hypothesis, however, has not been verified or disproved because it is difficult, both theoretically and experimentally, to quantify the solvent effects on the free energy change in protein folding. Here, we developed a computational method for extracting the dominant factor behind thermodynamic stability of proteins and applied it to a small, designed protein, chignolin. The resulting free energy profile quantitatively agreed with the molecular dynamics simulations. Decomposition of the free energy profile indicated that intramolecular interactions predominantly stabilized collapsed conformations, whereas solvent-induced interactions, including hydrophobic ones, destabilized them. These results obtained for chignolin were consistent with the site-directed mutagenesis and calorimetry experiments for globular proteins with hydrophobic interior cores.","[Sumi, Tomonari; Koga, Kenichiro] Okayama Univ, Res Inst Interdisciplinary Sci, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Tsushima Naka, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Sumi, Tomonari; Koga, Kenichiro] Okayama Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Tsushima Naka, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Sumi, T (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Res Inst Interdisciplinary Sci, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Tsushima Naka, Okayama 7008530, Japan.; Sumi, T (corresponding author), Okayama Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Tsushima Naka, Okayama 7008530, Japan.",sumi@okayama-u.ac.jp,"Sumi, Tomonari/C-2292-2015","Sumi, Tomonari/0000-0002-4230-5908; Koga, Kenichiro/0000-0002-1153-5831","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K05657, JP26287099, JP18KK0151]","This work was supported in part by JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP16K05657, No. JP26287099, and No. JP18KK0151.

Our approach is based on the exploitation of local, sequence-dependent structural information encoded in a database of three-residue fragments extracted from a large set of high-resolution experimentally determined protein structures. The computation of conformational transitions leading to the formation of the structural elements is formulated as a discrete path search problem using this database. To solve this problem, we propose a heuristically-guided depth-first search algorithm. The domain-dependent heuristic function aims at minimizing the length of the path in terms of angular distances, while maximizing the local density of the intermediate states, which is related to their probability of existence. We have applied the strategy to two small synthetic polypeptides mimicking two common structural motifs in proteins. The folding mechanisms extracted are very similar to those obtained when using traditional, computationally expensive approaches.

Dehydration upon folding can be characterized directly by all-atom simulations of fast pressure drops, which create desolvated pockets inside the nascent hydrophobic core. Here, we study pressure-drop refolding of three lambda-repressor fragment (lambda(6-85)) mutants computationally and experimentally. The three mutants report on tertiary structure formation via different fluorescent helix-helix contact pairs. All-atom simulations of pressure drops capture refolding and unfolding of all three mutants by a similar mechanism, thus validating the non-perturbative nature of the fluorescent contact probes. Analysis of simulated interprobe distances shows that the alpha-helix 1-3 pair distance displays a slower characteristic time scale than the 1-2 or 3-2 pair distance. To see whether slow packing of alpha-helices 1 and 3 is reflected in the rate-limiting folding step, fast pressuredrop relaxation experiments captured refolding on a millisecond time scale. These experiments reveal that refolding monitored by 1-3 contact formation indeed is much slower than when monitored by 1-2 or 3-2 contact formation. Unlike the case of the two-state folder [three-alpha-helix bundle (alpha 3D)], whose drying and core formation proceed in concert, lambda(6-85) repeatedly dries and rewets different local tertiary contacts before finally forming a solvent-excluded core, explaining the non-two-state behavior observed during refolding in molecular dynamics simulations. This work demonstrates that proteins can explore desolvated pockets and dry globular states numerous times before reaching the native conformation.","[Prigozhin, Maxim B.; Gruebele, Martin; Pogorelov, Taras V.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Zhang, Yi; Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin; Pogorelov, Taras V.] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Schulten, Klaus; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pogorelov, Taras V.] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Pogorelov, Taras V.] Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Prigozhin, Maxim B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Phys, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Gruebele, M; Pogorelov, TV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Gruebele, M; Pogorelov, TV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Gruebele, M (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Pogorelov, TV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Pogorelov, TV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Chem Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",mgruebel@illinois.edu; pogorelo@illinois.edu,"Pogorelov, Taras/AAH-8587-2020","Pogorelov, Taras/0000-0001-5851-7721","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM116961, R01GM093318, 9P41GM104601]; Howard Hughes Medical Institute International Student Research FellowshipHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Helen Hay Whitney Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM116961, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM116961, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM116961, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, R01GM093318, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank D.

Here, we present a new method, simultaneous coherent structure coloring (sCSC), which accomplishes the task of unsupervised clustering without a priori guidance regarding the underlying structure of the data. sCSC performs a sequence of binary splittings on the dataset such that the most dissimilar data points are required to be in separate clusters. To achieve this, we obtain a set of orthogonal coordinates along which dissimilarity in the dataset is maximized from a generalized eigenvalue problem based on the pairwise dissimilarity between the data points to be clustered. This sequence of bifurcations produces a binary tree representation of the system, from which the number of clusters in the data and their interrelationships naturally emerge. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method in the absence of a priori assumptions, we apply it to three exemplary problems in fluid dynamics. Then, we illustrate its capacity for interpretability using a high-dimensional protein folding simulation dataset. While we restrict our examples to dynamical physical systems in this work, we anticipate straightforward translation to other fields where existing analysis tools require ad hoc assumptions on the data structure, lack the interpretability of the present method, or in which the underlying processes are less accessible, such as genomics and neuroscience.","[Husic, Brooke E.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schlueter-Kuck, Kristy L.; Dabiri, John O.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dabiri, John O.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Husic, BE (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Dabiri, JO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Dabiri, JO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bhusic@stanford.edu; jodabiri@stanford.edu,,"Husic, Brooke/0000-0002-8020-3750",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Department of Defense (DoD) through the National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program,"BEH and JOD received no specific funding for this work.

However, their performance is inherently linked to the accuracy of the empirical force fields used in the simulations, whose optimisation and validation is of paramount importance.

Nevertheless, direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are often used for this purpose in the literature. To assess whether such approach is adequate, we have conducted a case study for a polymer+solvent system that has been commonly studied with direct MD simulations by many authors: poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in water. The total simulation time of the present study is much longer than that typically used in MD simulations of that system. A NIPAM chain of 30 monomers was studied in explicit water at 295K. Three initial configurations were used. For each configuration, five replicas were run for 1000ns. The statistical analysis of our data shows that the equilibration time is of the order of 600-700ns and that the remaining time for the production run is not sufficient to sample the equilibrium state adequately. These results underpin the well-known difficulty of sampling equilibrium states of polymers in solution with direct MD simulations and the need for a careful interpretation of results of such studies. The problem with the unsatisfactory sampling persists despite the increasing available computing power. Therefore, enhanced sampling techniques and workarounds, such as simplified scenarios or coarse-graining, remain important.","[Garcia, Edder J.; Hasse, Hans] Univ Kaiserslautern, Lab Engn Thermodynam LTD, Erwin Schrodinger Str 44, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany","Garcia, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Lab Engn Thermodynam LTD, Erwin Schrodinger Str 44, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",edder.garcia-manzano@mv.uni-kl.de,"Hasse, Hans/B-6439-2008","Hasse, Hans/0000-0003-4612-5995","Reinhart Koselleck Program of the German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [HA1993/15-1]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01IH16008F]; Boltzmann-Zuse Society of Computational Molecular Engineering (BZS); SuperMUC at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ), Garching [SPARLAMPE (pr48te)]","The authors acknowledge financial support from the Reinhart Koselleck Program (HA1993/15-1) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project TalPas (01IH16008F).

We describe the architecture and functionality of the library and the C and Fortran APIs which can be used to interface additional MD codes to MIST. We show, for a range of test systems, that MIST introduces negligible overheads for serial, shared memory parallel, and GPU-accelerated cases, except for Amber where the native integrators run directly on the GPU itself. As a demonstration of the capabilities of MIST, we describe a simulated tempering simulation used to study the free energy landscape of Alanine-12 in both vacuum and detailed solvent conditions.

The former allowed us to identify tripeptide sequences in existing protein three-dimensional structures with a strong preference for either helical or extended structure. The selected representatives of pro-helical and pro-extended sequences were converted into isolated tripeptides-capped at N- and C-termini-and these were subjected to an extensive conformational sampling and geometry optimization (typically thousands to tens of thousands of conformers for each tripeptide). For each conformer, the QM(DFT-D3)/COSMO-RS free-energy value was then calculated, G(conf)(solv). The Delta G(conf)(solv) is expected to provide an objective, unbiased, and quantitatively accurate measure of the conformational preference of the particular tripeptide sequence. It has been shown that irrespective of the helical vs extended preferences of the selected tripeptide sequences in context of the protein, most of the low-energy conformers of isolated tripeptides prefer the R-helical structure. Nevertheless, pro-helical tripeptides show slightly stronger helix preference than their pro-extended counterparts. Furthermore, when the sampling is repeated in the presence of a partner tripeptide to mimic the situation in a beta-sheet, pro-extended tripeptides (exemplified by the VIV) show a larger free-energy benefit than pro-helical tripeptides (exemplified by the EAM). This effect is even more pronounced in a hydrophobic solvent, which mimics the less polar parts of a protein. This is in line with our bioinformatic results showing that the majority of pro-extended tripeptides are hydrophobic. The preference for a specific secondary structure by the studied tripeptides is thus governed by the plasticity to adopt to its environment. In addition, we show that most of the naturally occurring conformations of tripeptide sequences, i.e., those found in existing three-dimensional protein structures, are within similar to 10 kcal.mol(-1) from their global minima. In summary, our ab initio data suggest that complex protein structures may start to emerge already at the level of their small oligopeptidic units, which is in line with a hierarchical nature of protein folding.","[Culka, Martin; Galgonek, Jakub; Vymetal, Jiri; Vondrasek, Jiri; Rulisek, Lubomir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Flemingovo Namesti 2, Prague 16610 6, Czech Republic","Vondrasek, J; Rulisek, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Organ Chem & Biochem, Flemingovo Namesti 2, Prague 16610 6, Czech Republic.",vondrasek@uochb.cas.cz; rulisek@uochb.cas.cz,"Vymetal, Jiri/R-1167-2017","Vymetal, Jiri/0000-0002-0165-8707; vondrasek, jiri/0000-0002-6066-973X; Culka, Martin/0000-0002-3944-152X","Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-24155S]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports from the Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovations project IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Center [LM2015070]; programme Projects of Large Research, Development, and Innovations Infrastructures [CESNET LM2015042]","The financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic is gratefully acknowledged (Grant No. 17-24155S).

We develop a highly efficient maximum entropy approach to fit SAXS data by introducing minimal biases to a coarse-grained protein force field, the associative memory, water mediated, structure, and energy model (AWSEM). We demonstrate that the resulting force field, AWSEM-SAXS, succeeds in reproducing scattering profiles and models protein structures with shapes that are in much better agreement with experimental results. Quantitative metrics further reveal a modest, but consistent, improvement in the accuracy of modeled structures when SAXS data are incorporated into the force field. Additionally, when applied to a multiconformational protein, we find that AWSEM-SAXS is able to recover the population of different protein conformations from SAXS data alone. We, therefore, conclude that the maximum entropy approach is effective in fine-tuning the force field to better characterize both protein structure and conformational fluctuation.","[Latham, Andrew P.; Zhang, Bin] MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Zhang, B (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Chem, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",binz@mit.edu,,"Latham, Andrew/0000-0002-9338-7253; Zhang, Bin/0000-0002-3685-7503",Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Ruby Krouwer Fellowship,This work was supported by startup funds from the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called OpenPathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant (RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.","[Swenson, David W.

Yet, the extensibility of OPS allows for the exploration of new path sampling algorithms by building on a variety of basic operations. In a companion paper [Swenson et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2018, 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00626] we introduced the basic concepts and the structure of the OPS package, and how it can be employed to perform standard transition path sampling and (replica exchange) transition interface sampling. In this paper, we elaborate on two theoretical developments that went into the design of OPS. The first development relates to the construction of path ensembles, the what is being sampled. We introduce a novel set-based notation for the path ensemble, which provides an alternative paradigm for constructing path ensembles and allows building arbitrarily complex path ensembles from fundamental ones. The second fundamental development is the structure for the customization of Monte Carlo procedures; how path ensembles are being sampled. We describe in detail the OPS objects that implement this approach to customization, the MoveScheme and the PathMover, and provide tools to create and manipulate these objects. We illustrate both the path ensemble building and sampling scheme customization with several examples. OPS thus facilitates both standard path sampling application in complex systems as well as the development of new path sampling methodology, beyond the default.","[Swenson, David W.

Herein, we report significant evidence for electrostatics being that driving force, using a simple, computationally inexpensive, multiscale model of monoamine oxidase A and phenylethylamine. We found that electrostatics provided by the enzyme substantially enhances the reaction by all the considered criteria (lowering the energy barrier, increasing charge transfer, decreasing the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap, increasing the dipole moment). The catalytic effect can be rationalized by the stabilizing interaction between the dipole moment of the reacting moiety and the electric field exerted by the charged environment. Both the dipole moment and the electric field are perceivably larger in the transition state as compared to the state of reactants; hence the transition state is stabilized to a larger extent and better solvated than the state of reactants, thereby lowering the barrier.

The complexes have been prepared by soaking, for different periods of time, native lysozyme crystals in solutions containing 2.5 M GuHCl. In the refined structures, the number of water molecules in the protein's first solvent shell has progressively decreased from 152 to 115, showing protein's preference for guanidinium over water. Guanidinium ions preferentially hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms. In their van der Waals interactions, they do not show any preference for apolar residues. Guanidinium ions have replaced water molecules that form cages around exposed hydrophobic residues. Guanidinium binding has decreased the average length of water-water hydrogen bond by 0.1 angstrom. The hydrogen bonds between main chain atoms have been weakened by GuHCl, and this may be the reason for increased potency of GuHCl compared to urea. Guanidinium binding destabilizes the beta-domain by causing loss of hydrogen bonds involving Asn 59 side chain. Interestingly, this loss is almost identical to that observed in structures of amyloidogenic variants of human lysozyme. Compounds preventing this loss could be anti-amyloidogenic.

Molecular simulations can potentially provide powerful insights into the nature of these relationships. The analysis of structures and molecular trajectories of nucleic acids can be nontrivial because it requires processing very high-dimensional data that are not easy to visualize and interpret. Here we introduce Barnaba, a Python library aimed at facilitating the analysis of nucleic acid structures and molecular simulations. The software consists of a variety of analysis tools that allow the user to (i) calculate distances between three-dimensional structures using different metrics, (ii) back-calculate experimental data from three-dimensional structures, (iii) perform cluster analysis and dimensionality reductions, (iv) search three-dimensional motifs in PDB structures and trajectories, and (v) construct elastic network models for nucleic acids and nucleic acids-protein complexes. In addition, Barnaba makes it possible to calculate torsion angles, pucker conformations, and to detect base-pairing/base-stacking interactions. Barnaba produces graphics that conveniently visualize both extended secondary structure and dynamics for a set of molecular conformations. The software is available as a command-line tool as well as a library, and supports a variety of file formats such as PDB, dcd, and xtc files.

In this study, we identified and quantified both thermodynamic stability and kinetic accessibility as the selection forces for protein evolution. The protein evolution can be viewed and quantified as a trajectory moving along a superfunneled energy landscape with a line attractor at the bottom. The resulting evolved sequences and structures show strong protein characteristics including the hydrophobic core, high designability, and fast folding.

Understanding the folding mechanism of proteins is valuable for predicting their 3D structures and for designing proteins with new functions and medicinal applications. Levinthal's paradox is that although the astronomical number of conformations possible even for proteins as small as 100 residues cannot be fully sampled, proteins in nature normally fold into the native state within timescales ranging from microseconds to hours. These conflicting results reveal that there are factors in organisms that can assist in protein folding. Methods: In this paper, we selected a crowded cell-like environment and temperature, and the top three Posttranslational Modifications (PTMs) as examples to show that Levinthal's paradox does not reflect the folding mechanism of proteins. We then revealed the effects of these factors on protein folding. Results: The results summarized in this review indicate that a crowded cell-like environment, temperature, and the top three PTMs reshape the Free Energy Landscapes (FELs) of proteins, thereby regulating the folding process. The balance between entropy and enthalpy is the key to understanding the effect of the crowded cell-like environment and PTMs on protein folding. In addition, the stability/flexibility of proteins is regulated by temperature. Conclusion: This paper concludes that the cellular environment could directly intervene in protein folding. The long-term interactions of the cellular environment and sequence evolution may enable proteins to fold efficiently. Therefore, to correctly understand the folding mechanism of proteins, the effect of the cellular environment on protein folding should be considered.","[Zeng, Juan; Huang, Zunnan] Guangdong Med Univ, Dongguan Sci Res Ctr, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Med Mol Diagnost, Dongguan 523808, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Juan] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Zeng, J; Huang, ZN (corresponding author), Guangdong Med Univ, 1 Xincheng Rd, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China.",azengjuan@hotmail.com; zn_huang@yahoo.com,"Huang, Zunnan/M-5214-2019","Huang, Zunnan/0000-0002-5821-703X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21603006, 31770774]",We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support (grant no. 21603006 to JZ 31770774 to ZH).,,145,0,0,2,6,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",0929-8673,1875-533X,,CURR MED CHEM,Curr.

Currently, a vast majority of PSP efforts are based on data mining of known sequences, structures and their relationships (informatics-based). However, if dosely related template is not available, these methods are usually much less reliable than experiments. They may also be problematic in predicting the structures of naturally occurring or designed peptides. On the other hand, physics-based methods including molecular dynamics (MD) can utilize our understanding of detailed atomic interactions determining biomolecular structures. In this mini-review, we show that all-atom MD can predict structures of cyclic peptides and other peptide foldamers with accuracy similar to experiments. Then, some notable successes in reproducing experimental 3D structures of small proteins through MD simulations (some with replica-exchange) of the folding were summarized. We also describe advancements of MD-based refinement of structure models, and the integration of limited experimental or bioinformatics data into MD-based structure modeling.

For these structures, methods for evaluating the stabilities, including the solvent effect, are also needed.

In this short review, we present an outline of the parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (PaCS-MD) method proposed by us and show its applications for several proteins to reveal biologically relevant phenomena.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP15J03797]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H06164]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP26102525, JP 26107004, JP 26105012]","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientist (No. JP15J03797) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (No. JP16H06164), and by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Dynamic Ordering and Biofunction, Photosynergetics, and 3D Active-Site Science (Nos.

Specifically the cases of candida albicans infection are increasing day by day and their resistance to clinically approved drugs is a major concern for humans. Various classes of antifungal drugs are available in the market for the treatment of these infections but unfortunately, none of them is able to treat the infection. Objectives: Thus, in the present investigation, we have repurposed the well-known drug (Fluvastatin) in the treatment of Candida albicans infections by using in silico, in vitro and ex vivo techniques. Material and Methods: Computational and in vitro techniques. Results: Firstly, we developed and validated a simple model of CYP45014 alpha-lanosterol demethylase of Candida albicans by using crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1EA1). Further, fluvastatin was docked with a validated model of CYP45014 alpha-lanosterol demethylase and revealed good binding affinity as that of fluconazole. In vitro results (Percentage growth retardation, Fungal growth kinetics, Biofilm test and Post antifungal test) have shown good antifungal activity of fluvastatin. Finally, the results of MTT assay have shown non-cytotoxic effect of fluvastatin in murine splenocytes and thymocytes. Conclusion: However, further in vivo studies are required to confirm the complete role of fluvastatin as an antifungal agent.","[Rana, Ritika; Kumar, Anoop] Indo Soviet Friendship Pharm Coll ISFCP, Dept Pharmacol, Moga, Punjab, India; [Sharma, Ruchika] ISFCP, Dept Biotechnol, Moga, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Anoop] Natl Inst Pharmaceut Educ & Res NIPER Raebareli, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Lucknow 226002, Uttar Pradesh, India","Kumar, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Pharmaceut Educ & Res NIPER Raebareli, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Lucknow 226002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",abitmesra@gmail.com,"Kumar, Anoop/A-3723-2016","Kumar, Anoop/0000-0002-7806-9986",,,,31,10,10,0,1,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1566-5240,1875-5666,,CURR MOL MED,Curr.

Continuum dielectric models often work well in describing the thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation and can be very efficient compared to the explicit treatment of the solvent. Here, we review a particular class of so-called fast implicit solvent models, generalized Born (GB) models, which are widely used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins and nucleic acids. These approaches model hydration effects and provide solvent-dependent forces with efficiencies comparable to molecular-mechanics calculations on the solute alone; as such, they can be incorporated into MD or other conformational searching strategies in a straightforward manner. The foundations of the GB model are reviewed, followed by examples of newer, emerging models and examples of important applications. We discuss their strengths and weaknesses, both for fidelity to the underlying continuum model and for the ability to replace explicit consideration of solvent molecules in macromolecular simulations.","[Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Dept Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Case, David A.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Dept Comp Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.; Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Dept Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",alexey@cs.vt.edu; david.case@rutgers.edu,,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM122086, R01GM122086, R01GM122086] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM122086] Funding Source: Medline",,,122,10,10,5,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1936-122X,1936-1238,978-0-8243-1848-2,ANNU REV BIOPHYS,Annu.

Atomistic folding simulations of a fast-folding mini-protein, CLN025, were employed to compare two commonly used explicit solvent water models, TIP3P and TIP4P/Ew, and one implicit solvent (AMBER generalized Born) model. Although all three solvent models correctly identify the same native folded state (RMSD = 1.5 +/- 0.1 A relative to the experimental structure), the corresponding free energy landscapes vary drastically between water models: almost an order-of-magnitude difference is seen in the predicted fraction of the unfolded state between the two explicit solvent models, with even larger differences between the implicit and the explicit models. Quantitative arguments are presented for why the sensitivity is expected to hold for other proteins, as well as for other conformational transitions involving large changes in solvent exposed areas such as protein ligand binding. Comparing protein solvent and solvent solvent contributions to the folding energy between different water models, water water electrostatic interactions are identified as the largest contributor to the differences in the predicted folding energy, which helps explain the strong sensitivity of the folding landscape to subtle details of the water model. For the two explicit solvent models, differences in water model parameters also result in the average number of water molecules surrounding the protein being noticeably different. Water models that poorly reproduce certain bulk properties of liquid water such as self-diffusion are likely to misrepresent water water interactions; we argue that within a pairwise additive energy function this error cannot, in general, be compensated by an adjustment to the solute solute and solute solvent parts of the energy.","[Anandakrishnan, Ramu] Edward Via Coll Osteopath Med, Dept Biomed Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Izadi, Saeed] Genentech Inc, Early Stage Pharmaceut Dev, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci & Phys, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Comp Sci & Phys, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",alexey@cs.vt.edu,"Anandakrishnan, Ramu/AAB-9040-2020","Anandakrishnan, Ramu/0000-0003-0422-3984",NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM076121],This work was supported in part by the NIH Grant No. GM076121 to A.V.O.

All-atom molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures and spectroscopic experiments in solution were performed for the wild-type fourU and its mutants. We found that the U11C and A8C mutations stabilize the fourU structure in comparison to the wild-type fourU, and the double-point G14A/C25U mutant has the most destabilizing effect on the fourU hairpin 2 responsible for temperature sensing.

Several adaptive sampling strategies have been proposed, but it is not clear which methods perform better for different physical systems. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of selected adaptive sampling strategies on a wide selection of fast folding proteins. The adaptive sampling strategies were emulated using models constructed on already existing MD trajectories. We provide theoretical limits for the sampling speed-up and compare the performance of different strategies with and without using some a priori knowledge of the system. The results show that for different goals, different adaptive sampling strategies are optimal. In order to sample slow dynamical processes such as protein folding without a priori knowledge of the system, a strategy based on the identification of a set of metastable regions is consistently the most efficient, while a strategy based on the identification of microstates performs better if the goal is to explore newer regions of the conformational space. Interestingly, the maximum speed-up achievable for the adaptive sampling of slow processes increases for proteins with longer folding times, encouraging the application of these methods for the characterization of slower processes, beyond the fast-folding proteins considered here.

Although nowadays simulated and measured biomolecule kinetics can be compared on the same time scale, a gap between computed and experimental observables remains. Here we directly compared temperature-jump experiments and molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding dynamics using the same observable: the time-dependent infrared spectrum. We first measured the stability and folding kinetics of the fastest-folding -protein, the GTT35 WW domain, using its structurally specific infrared spectrum. The relaxation dynamics of the peptide backbone, -sheets, turn, and random coil were measured independently by probing the amide I region at different frequencies. Next, the amide I spectra along folding/unfolding molecular dynamics trajectories were simulated by accurate mixed quantum/classical calculations. The simulated time dependence and spectral amplitudes at the exact experimental probe frequencies provided relaxation and folding rates in agreement with experimental observations. The calculations validated by experiment yield direct structural evidence for a rate-limiting reaction step where an intermediate state with either the first or second hairpin is formed. We show how folding switches from a more homogeneous (apparent two-state) process at high temperature to a more heterogeneous process at low temperature, where different parts of the WW domain fold at different rates.","[Davis, Caitlin M.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Davis, Caitlin M.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Davis, Caitlin M.; Dyer, R.

Protocols based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown promise, but current methods are limited to moderate levels of consistent refinement. To explore the energy landscape between homology models and native structures and analyze the challenges of MD-based refinement, eight test cases were studied via extensive simulations followed by Markov state modeling. In all cases, native states were found very close to the experimental structures and at the lowest free energies, but refinement was hindered by a rough energy landscape. Transitions from the homology model to the native states require the crossing of significant kinetic barriers on at least microsecond time scales. A significant energetic driving force toward the native state was lacking until its immediate vicinity, and there was significant sampling of off-pathway states competing for productive refinement. The role of recent force field improvements is discussed and transition paths are analyzed in detail to inform which key transitions have to be overcome to achieve successful refinement.","[Heo, Lim; Feig, Michael] Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Feig, M (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mfeiglab@gmail.com,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 GM084953, R35 GM126948]; National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) [TG-MCB090003]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R35GM126948, R01GM084953, R01GM084953, R35GM126948] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This research was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01 GM084953 and R35 GM126948.

Since biomolecular simulation datasets are inherently high dimensional, it is often necessary to build low dimensional representations that can be used to extract quantitative insights into the atomistic mechanisms that underlie complex biological processes.ResultsWe use a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn low dimensional, biophysically relevant latent features from long time-scale protein folding simulations in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate our approach on three model protein folding systems, namely Fs-peptide (14 s aggregate sampling), villin head piece (single trajectory of 125 s) and - - (BBA) protein (223 + 102 s sampling across two independent trajectories). In these systems, we show that the CVAE latent features learned correspond to distinct conformational substates along the protein folding pathways. The CVAE model predicts, on average, nearly 89% of all contacts within the folding trajectories correctly, while being able to extract folded, unfolded and potentially misfolded states in an unsupervised manner. Further, the CVAE model can be used to learn latent features of protein folding that can be applied to other independent trajectories, making it particularly attractive for identifying intrinsic features that correspond to conformational substates that share similar structural features.ConclusionsTogether, we show that the CVAE model can quantitatively describe complex biophysical processes such as protein folding.","[Bhowmik, Debsindhu; Gao, Shang; Young, Michael T.; Ramanathan, Arvind] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Sci & Engn Div, One Bethel Valley Rd,MS6085, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA","Ramanathan, A (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Computat Sci & Engn Div, One Bethel Valley Rd,MS6085, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",ramanathana@ornl.gov,,"Ramanathan, Arvind/0000-0002-1622-5488; BHOWMIK, DEBSINDHU/0000-0001-7770-9091",Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program; Laboratory Director's Research and Development Fund; National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health,Publications costs were funded in part by the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) program established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory Director's Research and Development Fund.,,42,6,6,1,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,Dec-21,2018,19,,,18,,,,,484,10.1186/s12859-018-2507-5,,,12,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,HF4NT,WOS:000454210600006,30577777,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Here, we perform long-time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to systematically evaluate the effect of explicit electronic polarization in polarizable force fields. The results show that the inclusion of electrostatic polarization effect in polarizable force fields can improve their accuracies in protein structure refinement and generate conformational ensembles more approximate to experiments for intrinsically disordered proteins. In contrast, it is difficult for polarizable force fields to approach the native structure, let alone to predict the native state when it is unknown a priori in the real protein structure predictions.

Ascertaining the smFES is of great value in understanding and engineering protein structure and function. By integrating tools from dynamical systems theory and nonlinear manifold learning, we describe an approach to reconstruct the multidimensional smFES for a protein from a time series in a single experimentally measurable observable. We employ Takens' delay embeddings to project the time series into a high-dimensional space in which the projected dynamics are C-1-equivalent to the true system dynamics and employ diffusion maps to recover a low-dimensional reconstruction of the smFES that is equivalent to the true smFES up to a smooth and invertible transformation. We validate the approach in molecular dynamics simulations of Trp-cage, Villin, and BBA to demonstrate that landscapes recovered from univariate time series in the head-to-tail distance are topologically identical-they precisely preserve the metastable states and folding pathways-and topographically approximate-the free energy barrier heights and well depths are approximately preserved-to the true landscapes determined from complete knowledge of all atomic coordinates. We go on to show that the reconstructed landscapes reliably predict temperature denaturation and identify point mutations and groups of mutations critical to folding.

Recently, we have utilized the combination of circular dichroism (CD) and site-specific C-13 isotopically edited infrared spectroscopy (IR) coupled with the Ising-like model for protein folding to map the thermal unfolding at the residue level of a de novo designed helix-turn-elix motif ata. Here we use the same methodology to study how the sequence of local thermal unfolding is affected by selected mutations introduced into the most and least stable parts of the motif. Seven different mutants of ata are screened to find substitutions with the most pronounced effects on the overall stability. Subsequently, thermal unfolding of two mutated alpha t alpha sequences is studied with site-specific resolution, using four distinct C-13 isotopologues of each. The data are analyzed with the Ising-like model, which builds on a previous parametrization for the original alpha t alpha sequence and tests different ways of incorporating the amino acid substitution. We show that for both more and less stable mutants only the adjustment of all interaction parameters of the model can yield a satisfactory fit to the experimental data. The stabilizing and destabilizing mutations result, respectively, in a similar increase and decrease of the stability of all probed local segments, irrespective of their position with respect to the mutation site. Consequently, the relative order of their unfolding remains essentially unchanged. These results underline the importance of the interconnectivity of the stabilizing interaction network and cooperativity of the protein structure, which is evident even in a small motif with apparently noncooperative, heterogeneous unfolding. Overall, our findings are consistent with the native structure being the dominant factor in determining the folding mechanism, regardless of the details of its overall or local thermodynamic stabilization.","[Lai, Jason K.; Kubelka, Ginka S.; Kubelka, Jan] Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA","Kubelka, J (corresponding author), Univ Wyoming, Dept Chem, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",laijasonk@gmail.com; gbuchner@uwyo.edu; jkubelka@uwyo.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CAREER 0846140],This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grant CAREER 0846140.,,44,0,0,0,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

However, commonly used one-dimensional landscapes typically fall short of this aim, because an empirical coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficient has to be fit to transition-path trajectory data in order to reproduce the transition-path dynamics. We show that an alternative, first-principles free energy landscape predicts transition-path statistics that agree well with simulations and single-molecule experiments without requiring dynamical data as an input. This topological configuration model assumes that distinct, native-like substructures assemble on a time scale that is slower than native-contact formation but faster than the folding of the entire protein. Using only equilibrium simulation data to determine the free energies of these coarse-grained intermediate states, we predict a broad distribution of transition-path transit times that agrees well with the transition-path durations observed in simulations. We further show that both the distribution of finite-time displacements on a one-dimensional order parameter and the ensemble of transition-path trajectories generated by the model are consistent with the simulated transition paths. These results indicate that a landscape based on transient folding intermediates, which are often hidden by onedimensional projections, can form the basis of a predictive model of protein-folding transition-path dynamics.","[Jacobs, William M.; Shakhnovich, Eugene I.] Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Shakhnovich, EI (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, 12 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shakhnovich@chemistry.harvard.edu,,"Shakhnovich, Eugene/0000-0002-4769-2265","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F32GM116231, GM068670]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, F32GM116231, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, F32GM116231, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670, R01GM068670] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors would like to thank D.E.

Thus, structure based (G (o) over bar) models have, aided by coarse-graining techniques, shown great success in capturing the mechanisms of protein folding and conformational changes. In certain cases, however, non-native interactions and atomic details are also essential to describe the protein dynamics, prompting the development of a variety of structure-based models that include non-native interactions, and differentiate between different types of attractive potentials. Here, we describe an all-protein-atom hybrid model, termed ProfasiGo, that integrates an implicit solvent all-atom physics-based model (called Profasi) and a structure-based G (o) over bar potential and its implementation in two software packages (PHAISTOS and ProFASi) that are developed for Monte Carlo sampling of protein molecules. We apply the ProfasiGo model to study the folding free energy landscapes of four topologically similar proteins, one of which can be folded by the simplified potential Profasi and two that have been folded by explicit solvent, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the CHARMM22* force field. Our results reveal that the hybrid ProfasiGo model is able to capture many of the details present in the physics-based potentials while retaining the advantages of G (o) over bar models for sampling and guiding to the native state. We expect that the model will be widely applicable to the study of the folding of more complex proteins or to the study of conformational dynamics and integration with experimental data.","[Wang, Yong; Tian, Pengfei; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark; [Tian, Pengfei] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Boomsma, Wouter] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.",lindorff@bio.ku.dk,"Boomsma, Wouter/K-2903-2014; Wang, Yong/J-3990-2012","Boomsma, Wouter/0000-0002-8257-3827; Wang, Yong/0000-0001-9156-0377; Tian, Pengfei/0000-0003-0255-8692",Novo Nordisk FoundationNovo Nordisk Foundation; BRAINSTRUC initiative from the Lundbeck Foundation; VILLUMFONDEN,K.L.-L. acknowledges funding by a Hallas-Moller Stipend from the Novo Nordisk Foundation and the BRAINSTRUC initiative from the Lundbeck Foundation.

We have previously reported that the M-state is formed rapidly (<1 ms) via a multistate process and thus offers a unique opportunity for exploring early stages of folding by both experimental and computational techniques. In order to gain structural insight into intermediates and barriers at the residue level, we studied the folding/unfolding kinetics of 12 apoMb mutants at pH 4.2 using fluorescence-detected ultrafast mixing techniques. Global analysis of the submillisecond folding/unfolding kinetics vs urea concentration for each variant, based on a sequential four-state mechanism (U double left right arrow I double left right arrow L double left right arrow M), allowed us to determine elementary rate constants and their dependence on urea concentration for most transitions. Comparison of the free energy diagrams constructed from the kinetic data of the mutants with that of wild-type apoMb yielded quantitative information on the effects of mutations on the free energy (Delta Delta G) of both intermediates and the first two kinetic barriers encountered during folding. Truncation of conserved aliphatic side chains on helices A, G, and H gives rise to a stepwise increase in Delta Delta G as the protein advances from U toward M, consistent with progressive stabilization of native-like contacts within the primary core of apoMb. Helix-helix contacts in the primary core contribute little to the first folding barrier (U double left right arrow I) and thus are not required for folding initiation but are critical for the stability of the late intermediate, L, and the M-state. Alanine substitution of hydrophobic residues at more peripheral helix-helix contact sites of the native structure, which are still absent or unstable in the M-state, shows both positive (destabilizing) and negative (stabilizing) Delta Delta G, indicating that non-native contacts are formed initially and weakened or lost as a result of subsequent structural rearrangement steps.","[Mizukami, Takuya; Xu, Ming; Fazlieva, Ruzaliya; Roder, Heinrich] Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Mol Therapeut Program, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA; [Bychkova, Valentina E.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Prot Sci, Lab Prot Phys, Pushchino 142290, Moscow Region, Russia","Roder, H (corresponding author), Fox Chase Canc Ctr, Mol Therapeut Program, Philadelphia, PA 19111 USA.",roder@fccc.edu,"Roder, Heinrich/B-3455-2009","Roder, Heinrich/0000-0003-1860-2491","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1412378]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CA06927, GM116911]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927, P30CA006927] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM116911, R01GM116911, R01GM116911, R01GM116911, R01GM116911] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Drs.

Low-energy, native, and non-native structures were used to iteratively refine 11 parameter values. The centroid of the largest cluster of structures sampled in simulations initiated from an extended conformation represents the predicted structure. The main-chain rms deviation of this prediction from the experimental structure was 0.47 angstrom for the 12-residue Trp-zip2, 0.86 angstrom for the 14-residue MBH12, 2.53 angstrom for the 17-residue U(1-17)T9D, 2.03 angstrom for the 20-residue BS1, 1.08 angstrom for the 20-residue Trp-cage, and 3.64 angstrom for the 35-residue villin headpiece subdomain HP35. The centroid of the sixth largest cluster sampled for HP35 deviated by 0.91 angstrom. The CHARMM22/CMAP force field was used, with an additional psi torsion term for residues other than glycine and proline. Six parameters govern the dielectric response of the continuum solvent, and four values of surface tension approximate nonpolar effects. An atom's self energy and interaction energies are screened independently, each depending on whether the atom is part of a charged group, a neutral hydrogen-bonding main-chain group, or any other neutral group. The parameters inferred result in strong main-chain hydrogen bonds, consistent with the view that protein folding is dominated by the formation of these bonds.(1,2) Conformations of MBH12 and BSI were excluded from the energy-function refinement, suggesting the parameters, referred to as SCP18, are transferable.

GroEL, a tetradecameric bacterial chaperonin, is one of the most studied chaperonins, but the role of the internal cavity in the refolding process is still unclear. It has been suggested that rather than simply isolating proteins while they refold, the GroEL cavity actively promotes protein folding. A detailed characterization of the folding dynamics and thermodynamics of protein substrates encapsulated within the cavity, however, has been difficult to obtain by experimental means, due to the system's complexity and the many steps in the folding cycle. Here, we examine the influence of the GroEL cavity on protein folding based on the results of unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We first verified that the computational setup, which uses a recently developed state-of-the-art force field that more accurately reproduces the aggregation propensity of unfolded states, could recapitulate the essential structural dynamics of GroEL. In these simulations, the GroEL tetradecamer was highly dynamic, transitioning among states corresponding to most of the structures that have been observed experimentally. We then simulated a small, unfolded protein both in the GroEL cavity and in bulk solution and compared the protein's folding process within these two environments. Inside the GroEL cavity, the unfolded protein interacted strongly with the disordered residues in GroEL's C-terminal tails. These interactions stabilized the protein's unfolded states relative to its compact states and increased the roughness of its folding free-energy surface, resulting in slower folding compared to the rate in solution. For larger proteins, which are more typical GroEL substrates, we speculate that these interactions may allow substrates to more quickly escape kinetic traps associated with compact, misfolded states, thereby actively promoting folding.","[Piana, Stefano; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA","Piana, S; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, 630 W 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,D.

Here we present a study performed on a stabilized mutant of the second beta-hairpin of the GB1 domain, where we combine steady-state fluorescence, laser-induced temperature-jump, and contact formation measurements to unveil the role of elementary structural components on hairpin dynamics and overall stability. In particular, our methodology provides access to the conformational dynamics of both the folded and unfolded state of the hairpin under native conditions, revealing the presence of extremely slow dynamics on the microsecond time scale in the unfolded state and coexistence of structures with partial pairing of the tails in the folded state. Comparing model peptides that mimic the turn sequence, we found that both ion pairing and hydrogen bonding due to the threonine side chain contribute to the propensity of turn formation but not to the much slower dynamics of the hydrophobic core formation. Interestingly, the dynamics of the turn region in isolation are significantly faster than the dynamics measured for the unfolded state of the complete hairpin, suggesting that non-native hydrophobic contacts slow down the reconfiguration dynamics of the unfolded state. Overall, the information extracted from these experiments provides kinetic limits on interconversions among conformational populations, hence enabling a simplified multistate free-energy landscape for the GB1 hairpin to be drawn.","[Soranno, Andrea] Washington Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Cabassi, Francesca; Orselli, Maria Elena; Buscaglia, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Med Biotechnol & Translat Med, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Cellmer, Troy] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Gori, Alessandro; Longhi, Renato] CNR, Ist Chim Riconoscimento Mol, I-20131 Milan, Italy","Buscaglia, M (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dept Med Biotechnol & Translat Med, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",marco.buscaglia@unimi.it,"Gori, Alessandro/A-1357-2019; Buscaglia, Marco/C-2435-2008","Gori, Alessandro/0000-0003-1640-7238; Buscaglia, Marco/0000-0001-5010-0278",Regione LombardiaRegione Lombardia,We thank William A.

The villin headpiece subdomain (HP36) has been extensively studied because of its simple three helix structure, ultrafast folding lifetime of a few microseconds, and stable native fold. We have previously shown that folding as measured by a single C-13=O-18 isotopic label on residue A57 in helix 2 occurs at a different rate than that measured by global probes of folding, indicating noncooperative complexity in the folding of HP36. In order to determine whether this complexity reflects intermediates or parallel pathways over a small activation barrier, C-13=O-18 labels were individually incorporated at six different positions in HP36, including into all 3 helices. The equilibrium thermal unfolding transitions and the folding/unfolding dynamics were monitored using the unique IR signature of the C-13=O-18 label by temperature dependent FTIR and temperature jump IR spectroscopy, respectively. Equilibrium experiments reveal that the C-13=O-18 labels at different positions in HP36 show drastic differences in the midpoint of their transitions (T-m), ranging from 45 to 67 degrees C. Heterogeneity is also observed in the relaxation kinetics; there are differences in the microsecond phase when different labeled positions are probed. At a final temperature of 45 degrees C, the relaxation rate for C-13=O-18 A57 is 2.4e + 05 s(-1) whereas for C-13=O-18 L69 HP36 the relaxation rate is 5.1e + 05 s(-1), two times faster. The observation of site dependent midpoints for the equilibrium unfolding transitions and differences in the relaxation rates of the labeled positions enables us to probe the progressive accumulation of the folded structure, providing insight into the microscopic details of the folding mechanism.","[Nagarajan, Sureshbabu; Dyer, R.

Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. In this study, we demonstrate how small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) information can be incorporated in Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased MD simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. Our results show that using SAXS data combined with additional information, such as thermodynamics and distance restraints, we are able to distinguish otherwise degenerate structures due to the inherent ambiguity of SAXS pattern. We further demonstrate that adaptive sampling guided by SAXS and hybrid information can significantly reduce the computation time required to discover target structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach in predicting near-native structures of proteins and complexes. Other low-resolution experimental information can be incorporated in a similar manner to collectively enhance unbiased sampling and improve the accuracy of structure prediction from simulation.","[Zhao, Chuankai; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar.shukla@shuklagroup.org,,"Zhao, Chuankai/0000-0002-6879-6514; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project - National Science Foundation [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research via the New Innovator Award in Food & Agriculture Research; 3M Corporate Fellowship from the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois","We acknowledge the support from the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

These experiments measure the relaxation of a particular labeled set of residue pairs, and the choice of residue pairs requires careful thought. As a result, experimentalists must pick residue pairs from a large pool of possibilities. In the current work, we show that molecular simulation datasets of protein dynamics can be used to systematically select an optimal set of residue positions to place probes for conducting spectroscopic experiments. The method described in this work, called Optimal Probes, can be used to rank trial sets of residue pairs in terms of their ability to capture the conformational dynamics of the protein. Optimal probes ensures two conditions: residue pairs capture the slow dynamics of the protein and their dynamics is not correlated for maximum information gain to score each trial set. Eventually, the highest scored set can be used for biophysical experiments to study the kinetics of the protein. The scoring methodology is based on kinetic network models of protein dynamics and a variational principle for molecular kinetics to optimize the hyperparameters used for the model. We also discuss that the scoring strategy used by Optimal Probes is the best possible way to ensure the ideal choice of residue pairs for experiments. We predict the best experimental probe positions for proteins lambda-repressor, beta(2) adrenergic receptor, and villin headpiece domain. These proteins have been well-studied and allow for a rigorous comparison of Optimal Probes predictions with already available experiments. Additionally, we also illustrate that our method can be used to predict the best choice for experiments by including any previous experiment choices available from other studies on the same protein. We consistently find that the best choice cannot be based on intuition or structural information such as distance difference between few known stable structures of the protein. Therefore, we show that incorporating protein dynamics could be used to maximize the information gain from experiments.","[Mittal, Shriyaa; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Mittal, Shriyaa/0000-0003-3490-1969; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research; CSE Fellows Program, Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL","The authors thank DE Shaw Research (DESRES), NY, and Pande Lab at Stanford University for MD simulation datasets.

The traditional trade-off in biomolecular simulation between accuracy and computational efficiency is predicated on the assumption that detailed force fields are typically well-parameterized, obtaining a significant fraction of possible accuracy. We re-examine this trade-off in the more realistic regime in which parameterization is a greater source of error than the level of detail in the force field. To address parameterization of coarse-grained force fields, we use the contrastive divergence technique from machine learning to train from simulations of 450 proteins. In our procedure, the computational efficiency of the model enables high accuracy through the precise tuning of the Boltzmann ensemble. This method is applied to our recently developed Upside model, where the free energy for side chains is rapidly calculated at every time-step, allowing for a smooth energy landscape without steric rattling of the side chains. After this contrastive divergence training, the model is able to de novo fold proteins up to 100 residues on a single core in days. This improved Upside model provides a starting point both for investigation of folding dynamics and as an inexpensive Bayesian prior for protein physics that can be integrated with additional experimental or bioinformatic data.","[Jumper, John M.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jumper, John M.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jumper, John M.; Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Faruk, Nabil F.] Univ Chicago, Grad Program Biophys Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Jumper, John M.] DeepMind, 5 New St Sq, London EC4A 3TW, England","Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",trsosnic@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599; Faruk, Nabil/0000-0003-3687-7114","National Institute of Health General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [GM55694, T32GM008720]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1363012, MCB-1517221]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada fellowshipNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [PGSD3-475231-2015]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [T32EB009412, T32EB009412, T32EB009412, T32EB009412, T32EB009412] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM055694, T32GM008720, R01GM055694, T32GM008720, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, T32GM008720, T32GM008720] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research is supported by the National Institute of Health General Medical Sciences grants GM55694 (TRS, KFF), and T32GM008720 (J Piccirilli); the National Science Foundation grants CHE-1363012 (KFF) and MCB-1517221 (B Roux); and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada fellowship PGSD3-475231-2015 (NFF).

Although state-of-the-art single-molecule approaches enable identification of conformational states, the transition path and metastable intermediates often remain elusive because they occur on microsecond time scales. Here we introduce a method to probe conformational dynamics with microsecond integration times based on a heterodimer of plasmonic particles. By combining Brownian dynamics and electromagnetic simulations, we find that integration times of 1 mu s can be routinely achieved, providing the capability to identify short-lived intermediates and transition paths at the single-molecule level in real-time. Importantly, plasmon rulers require no specialized equipment but can be probed on existing fluorescence microscopes equipped with a fast camera. The approach combines the advantages of fluorescent probes (zero-force, parallelization) and mechanical probes such as optical tweezers (continuous microsecond integration times). They offer a unique opportunity to study conformational dynamics and compare measurements to full-atom simulations, where computational demands limit the simulation time.","[Visser, Emiel W.

The free energy landscape of these simulations is often rugged, and minor differences in the initial velocities, floating-point precision, or underlying hardware can cause identical simulations (replicas) to take different paths in the landscape. In this study we investigated the magnitude of these effects based on 310 000 ns of simulation time. We performed 100 identically parametrized replicas of 3000 ns each for a small 10 amino acid system as well as 100 identically parametrized replicas of 100 ns each for an 827 residue T-cell receptor/MHC system. Comparing randomly chosen subgroups within these replica sets, we estimated the reproducibility and reliability that can be achieved by a given number of replicas at a given simulation time. These results demonstrate that conclusions drawn from single simulations are often not reproducible and that conclusions drawn from multiple shorter replicas are more reliable than those from a single longer simulation. The actual number of replicas needed will always depend on the question asked and the level of reliability sought. On the basis of our data, it appears that a good rule of thumb is to perform a minimum of five to 10 replicas.","[Knapp, Bernhard] Univ Int Catalunya, Dept Basic Sci, Bioinformat & Immunoinformat Res Grp, Barcelona 08195, Spain; [Knapp, Bernhard; Ospina, Luis; Deane, Charlotte M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Prot Informat Grp, Oxford OX1 3LB, England; [Ospina, Luis] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9SS, Lancs, England","Knapp, B (corresponding author), Univ Int Catalunya, Dept Basic Sci, Bioinformat & Immunoinformat Res Grp, Barcelona 08195, Spain.; Knapp, B (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Stat, Prot Informat Grp, Oxford OX1 3LB, England.",science.bernhard.knapp@gmail.com,,"Deane, Charlotte/0000-0003-1388-2252; Ospina-Forero, Luis/0000-0003-2941-6336","2020 Science Programme (UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Cross-Discipline Interface Programme) [EP/I017909/1]; Medical Research Council Systems (MRC) Approaches to Biomedical Science Centre for Doctoral Training [EP/L016044/1]; Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO), a la Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) y al Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) [BIO2017-83650-P]; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","This work was funded by the 2020 Science Programme (UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Cross-Discipline Interface Programme, EP/I017909/1), EPSRC and Medical Research Council Systems (MRC) Approaches to Biomedical Science Centre for Doctoral Training (EP/L016044/1), and a Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad (MINECO), a la Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) y al Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) (BIO2017-83650-P).

Three fluorophores are introduced, which, for simplicity, are associated with C-alpha beads. Two fluorophores are placed at the ends of protein chain and the third one at the middle of the chain. The free-energy surfaces (FESs) depending on the interfluorophore distances and on the FRET efficiencies corresponding to these distances have been constructed and compared with the FESs depending on the conventional collective variables, such as the fraction of native contacts and radius of gyration. It has been found that multicolor experiments can successfully resolve all essential BBL states that are revealed by the conventional FESs. The resolution of these states with the FRET-efficiency histogram is found to be successful if the energy transfer is measured between the fluorophores at the BBL ends. We also show that, although the present model construct of BBL is very simple, it captures some characteristic features of the single-molecule FRET experiments, such as the pattern of the FRET efficiency histograms and their evolution with the denaturant concentration.","[Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] RAS, Inst Thermophys, SB, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), RAS, Inst Thermophys, SB, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.; Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru,,,Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-04-00013],This work was supported by a grant from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (18-04-00013).,,56,2,2,0,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

To circumvent this impediment, a plethora of enhanced sampling methods has been developed. One important class of such methods relies on the application of a bias that is a function of a set of collective variables specially designed for the problem under consideration. The design of good collective variables can be challenging and thereby constitutes the main bottle neck in the application of these methods. To address this problem, recently we have introduced Harmonic Linear Discriminant Analysis, a method to systematically construct collective variables as linear combinations of a set of descriptors. The method uses input information that can be gathered in short unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which the system is trapped in the metastable states. Here, to scale up our examination of the method's efficiency, we applied it to the folding of chignolin in water. Interestingly, already before any biased simulations were run, the constructed one-dimensional collective variable revealed much of the physics that underlies the folding process. In addition, using it in metadynamics, we were able to run simulations in which the system goes from the folded state to the unfolded one and back, where to get fully converged results, we combined metadynamics with parallel tempering. Finally, we examined how the collective variable performs when different sets of descriptors are used in its construction. (C) 2018 Author(s).","[Mendels, Dan; Piccini, Giovannimaria; Brotzakis, Z.

Fluorescence lifetime is sensitive to the microenvironment and can be a molecular ruler when combined with FRET. Utilization of fluorescence lifetime in 2D FLCS thus enables us to quantify the inhomogeneity of the system and the interconversion dynamics among different species with a higher time resolution than other single-molecule techniques.

Namely, how do alternative sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence predictions generated from the data? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used sampling methods: (1) a single long simulation, (2) many short simulations run in parallel, (3) adaptive sampling, and (4) our recently developed goal-oriented sampling algorithm, FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for analytically calculating the probability of discovering select states on simple landscapes, where we uncover the drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes to characterize the probability of discovering particular states and transition pathways for each of the four methods. Consistently, we find that FAST simulations discover each target state with the highest probability, while traversing realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the potential pathology that short parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically circumnavigate. We refer to this pathology as pathway tunneling. To protect against this phenomenon when using adaptive-sampling and FAST simulations, we introduce the FAST-string method. This method enhances sampling along the highest-flux transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare the performance of a variety of MSM estimators in describing accurate thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend simply normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding small pseudocounts to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate whether our insights from simple landscapes hold for all atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding of the lambda-repressor protein. Remarkably, we find that FAST-contacts predicts the same folding pathway as a set of long simulations but with orders of magnitude less simulation time.","[Zimmerman, Maxwell I.; Porter, Justin R.; Sun, Xianqiang; Silva, Roseane R.; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",bowman@biochem.wustl.edu,,"Porter, Justin/0000-0002-0340-951X","NSF CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [MCB-1552471]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM12400701]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM124007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was funded by NSF CAREER Award MCB-1552471 and NIH R01GM12400701.,,83,12,12,0,5,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In this study, we combine template-based modeling with a realistic coarse-grained force field, AWSEM, that has been optimized using the principles of energy landscape theory. The Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM) is a coarse-grained force field having both transferable tertiary interactions and knowledge-based local-in-sequence interaction terms. We incorporate template information into AWSEM by introducing soft collective biases to the template structures, resulting in a model that we call AWSEM-Template. Structure prediction tests on eight targets, four of which are in the low sequence identity twilight zone of homology modeling, show that AWSEM-Template can achieve high-resolution structure prediction. Our results also confirm that using a combination of AWSEM and a template-guided potential leads to more accurate prediction of protein structures than simply using a template guided potential alone. Free energy profile analyses demonstrate that the soft collective biases to the template effectively increase funneling toward native-like structures while still allowing significant flexibility so as to allow for correction of discrepancies between the target structure and the template. A further stage of refinement using all-atom molecular dynamics augmented with soft collective biases to the structures predicted by AWSEM-Template leads to a further improvement of both backbone and side-chain accuracy by maintaining sufficient flexibility but at the same time discouraging unproductive unfolding events often seen in unrestrained all-atom refinement simulations. The all-atom refinement simulations also reduce patches of frustration of the initial predictions. Some of the backbones found among the structures produced during the initial coarse grained prediction step already have CE-RMSD values of less than 3 angstrom with 90% or more of the residues aligned to the experimentally solved structure for all targets. All-atom structures generated during the following all-atom refinement simulations, which started from coarse-grained structures that were chosen without reference to any knowledge about the native structure, have CE-RMSD values of less than 2.5 angstrom with 90% or more of the residues aligned for 6 out of 8 targets. Clustering low energy structures generated during the initial coarse-grained annealing picks out reliably structures that are within 1 angstrom of the best sampled structures in 5 out of 8 cases. After the all-atom refinement, structures that are within 1 angstrom of the best sampled structures can be selected using a simple algorithm based on energetic features alone in 7 out of 8 cases.","[Chen, Mingchen; Lin, Xingcheng; Lu, Wei; Schafer, Nicholas P.; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chen, Mingchen] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng; Lu, Wei; Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Schafer, Nicholas P.; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",pwolynes@rice.edu,"Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174; Wolynes, Peter/0000-0001-7975-9287; Chen, Mingchen/0000-0003-3916-7871",National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM445S7]; D.R.

In a recent publication, precise defining characteristics of such reaction coordinates were identified and linked to the existence of a so-called transition manifold. This theory gives rise to a novel numerical method for the pointwise computation of reaction coordinates that relies on short parallel MD simulations only, but yields accurate approximation of the long time behavior of the system under consideration. This article presents an extension of the method towards practical applicability in computational chemistry. It links the newly defined reaction coordinates to concepts from transition path theory and Markov state model building. The main result is an alternative computational scheme that allows for a global computation of reaction coordinates based on commonly available types of simulation data, such as single long molecular trajectories or the push-forward of arbitrary canonically distributed point clouds. It is based on a Galerkin approximation of the transition manifold reaction coordinates that can be tuned to individual requirements by the choice of the Galerkin ansatz functions. Moreover, we propose a ready-to-implement variant of the new scheme, which computes data-fitted, mesh-free ansatz functions directly from the available simulation data. The efficacy of the new method is demonstrated on a small protein system.

As the order parameters to characterize its conformational change, we here use the coordinates derived from the diffusion map (DM) method, one of the manifold learning techniques. As a concrete example, we study the kinetic properties of a small peptide, chignolin in explicitwater, and calculate the conformational change between the folded and misfolded states in a nonequilibrium way. We find that the transition time scales thus obtained are comparable to those using previously employed hydrogen-bond distances as the order parameters. Since the DM method only uses the 3D Cartesian coordinates of a peptide, this shows that the DM method can extract the important distance information of the peptide without relying on chemical intuition. The time scales are compared well with the previous results using different techniques, non-Markovian analysis and core-set milestoning for a single long trajectory. We also find that the most significant DM coordinate turns out to extract a dihedral angle of glycine, and the previously studied relaxation modes are well correlated with the most significant DM coordinates.

However, a complete mechanism for this process, which requires allosteric communication between binding sites that are similar to 30 angstrom apart, remains elusive. We construct an atomically detailed model of G protein activation by combining three powerful computational methods: metadynamics, Markov state models (MSMs), and CARDS analysis of correlated motions. We uncover a mechanism that is consistent with a wide variety of structural and biochemical data. Surprisingly, the rate-limiting step for GDP release correlates with tilting rather than translation of the GPCR-binding helix 5. beta-Strands 1 - 3 and helix 1 emerge as hubs in the allosteric network that links conformational changes in the GPCR-binding site to disordering of the distal nucleotide-binding site and consequent GDP release. Our approach and insights provide foundations for understanding disease-implicated G protein mutants, illuminating slow events in allosteric networks, and examining unbinding processes with slow off-rates.","[Sun, Xianqiang; Singh, Sukrit; Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Blumer, Kendall J.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cell Biol & Physiol, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Bowman, Gregory R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA","Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.; Bowman, GR (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Biol Syst Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",g.bowman@wustl.edu,,"Singh, Sukrit/0000-0003-1914-4955; Bowman, Gregory/0000-0002-2083-4892","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM12400701, R01GM044592, R01GM12409301]; National Science Foundation CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CB1552471]; David and Lucile Packard Foundation Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM124007, R01GM124093, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM124007, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM044592, R01GM124007, R01GM124093, R01GM044592, R01GM124093, R01GM124007, R01GM124007, R01GM044592, R01GM124007] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institutes of Health Grant R01GM12400701 Gregory R Bowman M National Science Foundation CAREER Award CB1552471 Gregory R Bowman; David and Lucile Packard Foundation Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering Gregory R Bowman; National Institutes of Health Grant R01GM044592 Kendall J Blumer Gregory R Bowman; National Institutes of Health Grant R01GM12409301 Kendall Blumer Gregory R Bowman; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,87,10,10,0,6,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,Oct-05,2018,7,,,,,,,,e38465,10.7554/eLife.38465,,,24,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,GZ5JA,WOS:000449453900001,30289386,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Biased sampling can artificially drive the simulation along prespecified collective variables (CVs), but success depends critically on the availability of good CVs associated with the important collective dynamical motions. Nonlinear machine learning techniques can identify such CVs but typically do not furnish an explicit relationship with the atomic coordinates necessary to perform biased sampling. In this work, we employ auto-associative artificial neural networks (autoencoders) to learn nonlinear CVs that are explicit and differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates. Our approach offers substantial speedups in exploration of configurational space, and is distinguished from existing approaches by its capacity to simultaneously discover and directly accelerate along data-driven CVs. We demonstrate the approach in simulations of alanine dipeptide and Trp-cage, and have developed an open-source and freely available implementation within OpenMM.

Here we report single-molecule atomic force microscopy experiments on gpW, a protein that, in bulk, folds in a few microseconds over a marginal folding barrier (similar to 1 k(B)T). Applying pulling forces of only 5 pN, we maintain gpW in quasi-equilibrium near its mechanical unfolding midpoint and detect how it interconverts stochastically between the folded and an extended state. The interconversion pattern is distinctly binary, indicating that, under an external force, gpW (un) folds over a significant free-energy barrier. Using molecular simulations and a theoretical model we rationalize how force induces such barrier in an otherwise downhill free-energy surface.

These simulations capture the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules in full atomic detail and at very fine temporal resolution. Major improvements in simulation speed, accuracy, and accessibility, together with the proliferation of experimental structural data, have increased the appeal of biomolecular simulation to experimentalists-a trend particularly noticeable in, although certainly not limited to, neuroscience. Simulations have proven valuable in deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Here we describe, in practical terms, the types of information MD simulations can provide and the ways in which they typically motivate further experimental work.","[Hollingsworth, Scott A.; Dror, Ron O.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hollingsworth, Scott A.; Dror, Ron O.] Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hollingsworth, Scott A.; Dror, Ron O.] Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hollingsworth, Scott A.; Dror, Ron O.] Stanford Univ, Inst Computat & Math Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Mol & Cellular Physiol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Struct Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.; Dror, RO (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Inst Computat & Math Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ron.dror@stanford.edu,"Cote, Rick H/G-3363-2013","Cote, Rick H/0000-0002-1573-6526","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM127359]; NIH Biomedical Informatics postdoctoral fellowship [T15-LM007033-33]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM127359, R01GM127359, R01GM127359] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) [T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033, T15LM007033] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Brian Kobilka, Oliver Beckstein, Mark Sansom, Jose Faraldo-Gomez, Naomi Latorraca, Robin Betz, Raphael Townshend, Joseph Paggi, A.J.

With the advent of modern bioanalytical techniques, however, previously unappreciated roles for D-amino acids in biological processes have been revealed. Over 30 D-amino acid containing peptides (DAACPs) have been discovered in animals where at least one L-residue has been isomerized to the D-form via an enzyme-catalyzed process. In Aplysia californica, GdFFD and GdYFD (the lower-case letter d'' indicates a D-amino acid residue) modulate the feeding behavior by activating the Aplysia achatin-like neuropeptide receptor (apALNR). However, little is known about how the three-dimensional conformation of DAACPs influences activity at the receptor, and the role that D-residues play in these peptide conformations. Here, we use a combination of computational modeling, drift-tube ion-mobility mass spectrometry, and receptor activation assays to create a simple model that predicts bioactivities for a series of GdFFD analogs. Our results suggest that the active conformations of GdFFD and GdYFD are similar to their lowest energy conformations in solution. Our model helps connect the predicted structures of GdFFD analogs to their activities, and highlights a steric effect on peptide activity at position 1 on the GdFFD receptor apALNR. Overall, these methods allow us to understand ligand-receptor interactions in the absence of high-resolution structural data.","[Thanh D Do; Checco, James W.; Sweedler, Jonathan, V] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Thanh D Do; Checco, James W.; Sweedler, Jonathan, V] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Tro, Michael; Shea, Joan-Emma; Bowers, Michael T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Chem & Biochem, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Shea, Joan-Emma] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Phys, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Thanh D Do] Univ Tennessee, Dept Chem, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA","Do, TD; Sweedler, JV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Do, TD; Sweedler, JV (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Do, TD (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Chem, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",tdo5@utk.edu; jsweedle@illinois.edu,"Sweedler, Jonathan V/A-9405-2009; Checco, James W./AAY-3374-2020; Do, Thanh/D-5170-2017","Sweedler, Jonathan V/0000-0003-3107-9922; Checco, James W./0000-0003-1165-6163; Do, Thanh/0000-0002-1978-4365","National Institutes of Health from the National Institute on Drug Abuse [P30 DA018310]; National Institutes of Health from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [R01 NS031609]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1565941, MCB-1716956, OCI-1053575]; XSEDE [TG-CHE150069, TG-MCA05S027]; Center for Scientific Computing at the CNSI; MRL at the University of California at Santa Barbara: an NSF MRSEC [DMR-1121053]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-0960316]; Beckman Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship - Beckman Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609, R01NS031609] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310, P30DA018310] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We gratefully acknowledge support from the National Institutes of Health, Award No. P30 DA018310 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Award No. R01 NS031609 from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (both to J.V.S.), and the National Science Foundation, Award No. CHE-1565941 (M.T.B.) and MCB-1716956 (J.-E.S.).

Atomistic computer simulations using physics-based force fields can provide important insights on the interplay of different interactions and energetics and their roles in governing the folding thermodynamics and mechanism. In particular, generalized Born (GB)-based implicit solvent force fields can be optimized to provide an appropriate balance between solvation and intramolecular interactions and successfully recapitulate experimental conformational equilibria for a set of helical and beta-hairpin peptides. Here, we further demonstrate that key thermodynamic properties and their temperature dependence obtained from replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of these peptides are in quantitative agreement with experimental results. Useful lessons can be learned on how the interplay of entropy and sequentially long-range interactions governs the mechanism and cooperativity of folding.

Recent experiments have provided cases of systems with slow reconfiguration dynamics, perhaps arising from frustration. While it is well known that protein folding speed and mechanism are strongly affected by the protein native structure, it is still unknown how the response to frustration is modulated by the protein topology. We explore the effects of nonnative interactions in the reconfigurational and folding dynamics of proteins with different sizes and topologies. We find that structural correlations related to the folded state size and topology play an important role in determining the folding kinetics of proteins that otherwise have the same amount of nonnative interactions. In particular, we find that the reconfiguration dynamics of alpha-helical proteins are more susceptible to frustration than beta-sheet proteins of the same size. Our results may explain recent experimental findings and suggest that attempts to measure the degree of frustration due to nonnative interactions might be more successful with alpha-helical proteins.","[Kluber, Alex; Burt, Timothy A.; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Kluber, Alex; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Burt, Timothy A.] Univ Houston, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77004 USA","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",cecilia@rice.edu,,"Burt, Timothy/0000-0002-0616-8328","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1427654]; Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI award (NSF Grant) [CNS-1338099]","We are grateful to members of the C.C. research group for inspiring discussions.

This remains true even in the case of simple two state systems and only increases in difficulty for multi-state systems.

In particular, we show how the decision functions in SML algorithms can be used as initial CVs (SMLcv) for accelerated sampling. Using solvated alanine dipeptide and Chignolin mini-protein as our test cases, we illustrate how the distance to the support vector machines' decision hyperplane, the output probability estimates from logistic regression, the outputs from shallow or deep neural network classifiers, and other classifiers may be used to reversibly sample slow structural transitions.

To overcome this bottleneck, we present the REinforcement learning based Adaptive samPling (REAP) algorithm that aims to efficiently sample conformational space by learning the relative importance of each order parameter as it samples the landscape. To achieve this, the algorithm uses concepts from the field of reinforcement learning, a subset of machine learning, which rewards sampling along important degrees of freedom and disregards others that do not facilitate exploration or exploitation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of REAP by comparing the sampling to long continuous MD simulations and least-counts adaptive sampling on two model landscapes (L-shaped and circular) and realistic systems such as alanine dipeptide and Src kinase. In all four systems, the REAP algorithm consistently demonstrates its ability to explore conformational space faster than the other two methods when comparing the expected values of the landscape discovered for a given amount of time. The key advantage of REAP is on-the-fly estimation of the importance of collective variables, which makes it particularly useful for systems with limited structural information.","[Shamsi, Zahra; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cheng, Kevin J.; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar@illinois.edu,,"Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign; National Academies of Arts, Sciences and Medicine","Authors acknowledge the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois.

The most reliable methods centre on template based modelling. However, the accuracy of these models entirely depends on the availability of experimentally resolved homologous template structures. In order to generate more accurate models, extensive physics based molecular dynamics (MD) refinement simulations are performed to sample many different conformations to find improved conformational states. In this study, we propose a deep recurrent network model, called DeepTrajectory, that is able to identify these improved conformational states, with high precision, from a variety of different MD based sampling protocols. The proposed model learns the temporal patterns of features computed from MD trajectory data in order to classify whether each recorded simulation snapshot is an improved quality conformational state, decreased quality conformational state or whether there is no perceivable change in state with respect to the starting conformation. The model was trained and tested on 904 trajectories from 42 different protein systems with a cumulative number of more than 1.7 million snapshots. We show that our model outperforms other state of the art machine-learning algorithms that do not consider temporal dependencies. To our knowledge, DeepTrajectory is the first implementation of a time-dependent deep-learning protocol that is re-trainable and able to adapt to any new MD based sampling procedure, thereby demonstrating how a neural network can be used to learn the latter part of the protein folding funnel.","[Pfeiffenberger, Erik; Bates, Paul A.] Francis Crick Inst, Biomol Modelling Lab, 1 Midland Rd, London NW1 1AT, England","Bates, PA (corresponding author), Francis Crick Inst, Biomol Modelling Lab, 1 Midland Rd, London NW1 1AT, England.",paul.bates@crick.ac.uk,"Bates, Paul A/AAF-8561-2020","Bates, Paul A/0000-0003-0621-0925",Francis Crick Institute; Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [FC001003]; UK Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [FC001003]; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [FC001003],"This work was supported by the Francis Crick Institute, which receives its core funding from Cancer Research UK (FC001003), the UK Medical Research Council (FC001003), and the Wellcome Trust (FC001003).

To elucidate the essential dynamics, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool. However, it might still be difficult to address the relevant conformational transitions of proteins with the conventional MD (CMD) because the accessible time scales of CMD are far from those of the biological functions. Furthermore, the essential transitions are induced as stochastic processes in the long time scales, i.e. the conformational transitions are regarded as biologically relevant rare events. To reproduce/predict the rare events, we have proposed several enhanced conformational sampling methods. Our strategy to detect the rare events is based on cycles of the following conformational resampling consisting of two steps. (1) Selections of essential initial structures. (2) Restarting of short-time MD simulations from the initial structures. The cycles of conformational resampling increase the transition probabilities, promoting the rare events. In the present article, we review the enhanced conformational sampling methods developed by us, i.e. parallel cascade selection MD (PaCS-MD), fluctuation flooding method (FFM), taboo search algorithm (TBSA), outlier flooding method (OFLOOD), structural dissimilarity sampling (SDS), and self-avoiding conformational sampling (SACS). Furthermore, we introduce representative applications using our methods for several biological systems.","[Harada, Ryuhei] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan","Harada, R (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H06164]; Initiative on Promotion of Supercomputing for Young or Women Researchers, Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center at Tokyo Institute of Technology","R.

However, the exact acceleration of biomolecular dynamics or speedup of kinetic rates in GaMD simulations and, more broadly, in enhanced sampling methods, remains a challenging task to be determined. Here, the GaMD acceleration is examined using alanine dipeptide in explicit solvent as a biomolecular model system. Relative to long conventional molecular dynamics simulation, GaMD simulations exhibited similar to 36-67 times speedup for sampling of the backbone dihedral transitions. The acceleration depended on level of the GaMD boost potential. Furthermore, Kramers' rate theory was applied to estimate GaMD acceleration using simulation-derived diffusion coefficients, curvatures and barriers of free energy profiles. In most cases, the calculations also showed significant speedup of dihedral transitions in GaMD, although the GaMD acceleration factors tended to be underestimated by similar to 3-96 fold. Because greater boost potential can be applied in GaMD simulations of systems with increased sizes, which potentially leads to higher acceleration, it is subject to future studies on accelerating the dynamics and recovering kinetic rates of larger biomolecules such as proteins and protein-protein/nucleic acid complexes.

In conjunction with enhanced sampling methods, such as replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), these frameworks allow the systematic and accurate extraction of transition probabilities between the corresponding states, in the case of Markov state models, and of statistically-optimized transition rates, in the case of the corresponding coarse master equations. However, applying automatically such methods to large molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with explicit water molecules, remains limited both by the initial ability to identify good candidates for the underlying Markovian states and by the necessity to do so using good collective variables as reaction coordinates that allow the correct counting of inter-state transitions at various lag times. Here, we show that, in cases when representative molecular conformations can be identified for the corresponding Markovian states, and thus their corresponding collective evolution of atomic positions can be calculated along MD trajectories, one can use them to build a new type of simple collective variable, which can be particularly useful in both the correct state assignment and in the subsequent accurate counting of inter-state transition probabilities. In the case of the ubiquitously used root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, we introduce the relative RMSD (Re1RMSD) measure as a good reaction coordinate candidate. We apply this method to the analysis of REMD trajectories of amyloid-forming diphenylalanine (FF) peptides-a system with important nanotechnology and biomedical applications due to its self-assembling and piezoelectric properties-illustrating the use of Re1RMSD in extracting its temperature-dependent intrinsic kinetics, without a priori assumptions on the functional form (e.g., Arrhenius or not) of the underlying conformational transition rates. The Re1RMSD analysis enables as well a more objective assessment of the convergence of the REMD simulations. This type of collective variable may be generalized to other observables that could accurately capture conformational differences between the underlying Markov states (e.g., distance RMSD, the fraction of native contacts, etc.).","[Narayan, Brajesh; Herbert, Colm; Yuan, Ye; Rodriguez, Brian J.; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Narayan, Brajesh; Herbert, Colm; Yuan, Ye; Buchete, Nicolae-Viorel] Univ Coll Dublin, Inst Discovery, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Rodriguez, Brian J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Conway Inst Biomol & Biomed Res, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Brooks, Bernard R.] NHLBI, Lab Computat Biol, NIH, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Phys, Dublin 4, Ireland.; Buchete, NV (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Inst Discovery, Dublin 4, Ireland.",buchete@ucd.ie,"Rodriguez, Brian/Q-7195-2019; Rodriguez, Brian/AAF-1428-2020","Rodriguez, Brian/0000-0001-9419-2717; ","DJEI/DES/SFI/HEA Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC)Science Foundation Ireland; Biowulf cluster at the National Institutes of Health, United StatesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Irish Research Council (IRC)Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology; UCD School of Physics; NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) [ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001050, ZIAHL001050, ZIAHL001050, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001050, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051, ZIAHL001051] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We wish to thank the DJEI/DES/SFI/HEA Irish Centre for High-End Computing (ICHEC), and the Biowulf cluster at the National Institutes of Health, United States (http://biowulf.nih.gov) for the provision of computational facilities and support.

While both remain very difficult, predictions of kinetics are particularly difficult because rates, in contrast to free energies, depend on the route taken. For this reason, specific enhanced sampling methods are needed to calculate long-time scale kinetics. It has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to recover kinetics through the so-called infrequent metadynamics simulations, where the simulations are biased in a way that minimally corrupts the dynamics of moving between metastable states. This method, however, requires the bias to be added slowly, thus hampering applications to processes with only modest separations of time scales. Here we present a frequency-adaptive strategy which bridges normal and infrequent metadynamics. We show that this strategy can improve the precision and accuracy of rate calculations at fixed computational cost and should be able to extend rate calculations for much slower kinetic processes.

We also designed a novel model selection method to blindly select high-quality models from very long simulation trajectories. The combined use of PCST-SBM with the blind selection method yielded final models that are better than initial models. For Top-1 group, 7 out of 23 targets had better models (greater global distance test total scores) than the critical assessment of structure prediction participants.

Crystallographic and biochemical data suggest that a loop-tocoiled-coil transition of the B-loop region of HA is important for driving this structural rearrangement. However, the microscopic picture for this proposed spring-loaded movement is missing. In this study, we focus on understanding the transition of the B loop and perform a set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full B-loop trimeric structure with the CHARMM36 force field. The free-energy profile constructed from our simulations describes a B loop that stably folds half of the postfusion coiled coil in tens of microseconds, but the full coiled coil is unfavorable. A buried hydrophilic residue, Thr59, is implicated in destabilizing the coiled coil. Interestingly, this conserved threonine is the only residue in the B loop that strictly differentiates between the group 1 and 2 HA molecules. Microsecond-scale constant temperature simulations revealed that kinetic traps in the structural switch of the B loop can be caused by nonnative, intramonomer, or intermonomer beta-sheets. The addition of the A helix stabilized the postfusion state of the B loop, but introduced the possibility for further beta-sheet structures. Overall, our results do not support a description of the B loop in group 2 HAs as a stiff spring, but, rather, it allows for more structural heterogeneity in the placement of the fusion peptides during the fusion process.","[Lin, Xingcheng; Ma, Jianpeng; Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng; Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Noel, Jeffrey K.] Max Delbruck Ctr Mol Med, Crystallog, D-13125 Berlin, Germany; [Wang, Qinghua; Ma, Jianpeng] Baylor Coll Med, Verna & Marrs McLean Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ma, Jianpeng] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Onuchic, Jose N.] Rice Univ, Dept BioSci, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Onuchic, JN (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA.; Onuchic, JN (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Onuchic, JN (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Onuchic, JN (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept BioSci, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jonuchic@rice.edu,"Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174","Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - NSF [PHY-1427654]; NSF Division of Chemistry Grant [1614101]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1792, Q-1512, Q-1826]; National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-GM110310, R01-GM067801, R01-GM116280, R01-GM127628, R01-AI067839]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-0818353, ACI-1548562]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) through National Institutes of Health [PSCA14037P, R01-GM116961]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R01AI067839, R01AI067839, R01AI067839, R01AI067839, R01AI067839] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM110310, R01GM110310, R01GM110310, R01GM110310, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM116961, R01GM116961, R01GM127628, R01GM127628, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM116280, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM116280, R01GM116280, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM127628, R01GM110310, R01GM116961, R01GM067801, R01GM067801, R01GM116961, R01GM116280, R01GM067801, R01GM067801] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics sponsored by NSF Grant PHY-1427654 and also by NSF Division of Chemistry Grant 1614101 and Welch Foundation Grant C-1792.

To understand the role of non-native interactions on the folding of some frustrated proteins in chaperone, we employed native-centric models with and without additional transferable, sequence-dependent non-native hydrophobic interactions to comparatively study the folding behaviors of the three proteins confined in spherical cages. Under purely repulsive confinement, as a decrease of cavity size, the non-native interactions increase, especially in the unfolded state, enhancing the roughness of the folding energy landscape. As a result, the increase in native stability for the three proteins by the model incorporated non-native interactions (db + MJh phi model) is much smaller than that by the purely native-centric model (desolvation-barrier (db) model); the acceleration of folding simulated by the db + MJh phi model is much slower than that via the db model; in particular, the folding rate of Im7 decreases when reducing the cavity size under zero-denaturant condition. The repulsive confinement can also promote formation of specific non-native contacts in the transition state and favor more folding pathways passing through the misfolded state, leading to a higher population of the misfolded intermediate. In an attractive cage, the attractive interactions could inhibit the formation of intrachain non-native contacts and provide alternate folding pathways to the native state so that the population of the misfolded intermediate decreases when increasing the strength of attractive interaction between the substrate protein and cavity wall. This study should be helpful in general to understand how the chaperonins reshape the folding energy landscape of some frustrated proteins.","[Cheng, Chenqian; Wu, Jing; Liu, Gaoyuan; Shi, Suqing; Chen, Tao] Northwest Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Synthet & Nat Funct Mol Chem, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chen, T (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Synthet & Nat Funct Mol Chem, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tchen@nwu.edu.cn,,,Open Research Fund of Guangdong Key Laboratory of High Performance & Functional Polymer Materials [20160001]; Fundamental Research Fund for Northwest University [338020014]; National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates [201710697013]; Top-rated Discipline construction scheme of Shaanxi higher education,"This work was supported by the Open Research Fund of Guangdong Key Laboratory of High Performance & Functional Polymer Materials (20160001), the Fundamental Research Fund for Northwest University (338020014), the National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (201710697013), and the Top-rated Discipline construction scheme of Shaanxi higher education.",,92,1,1,0,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

While the development of the implicit models is mainly focused on the methodological improvement and key parameter optimization for polar solvation, nonpolar solvation has been either ignored or described by a simplistic surface area (SA) model. In this work, we performed the folding simulations of multiple beta-hairpin and alpha-helical proteins with varied surface tension coefficients embedded in the SA model to clearly demonstrate the effects of nonpolar solvation treated by a popular SA model on protein folding. The results indicate that the change in the surface tension coefficient does not alter the ability of implicit solvent simulations to reproduce a protein native structure but indeed controls the components of the equilibrium conformational ensemble and modifies the energetic characterization of the folding transition pathway. The suitably set surface tension coefficient can yield explicit solvent simulations and/or experimentally suggested folding mechanism of protein. In addition, the implicit treatment of both polar and nonpolar components of solvation free-energy contributes to the overestimation of the secondary structure in implicit solvent simulations.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Materia Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Materia Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095",National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFA0502301]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) [U1501501],"The authors thank the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2016YFA0502301), the National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and the Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501 for financial support.

Using multidimensional band-excitation scanning probe spectroscopy and adapting tools from both computer vision and machine learning, an automated workflow is developed to featurize, detect, and classify signatures of ferroelectric/ferroelastic switching processes in complex ferroelectric domain structures. This approach enables the identification and nanoscale visualization of varied modes of response and a pathway to statistically meaningful quantification of the differences between those modes. Among other things, the importance of domain geometry is spatially visualized for enhancing nanoscale electromechanical energy conversion.","[Agar, Joshua C.; Pandya, Shishir; Luo, Aileen I.; Maher, Joshua T.; Martin, Lane W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cao, Ye] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Cao, Ye; Balke, Nina; Jesse, Stephen; Kalinin, Sergei V.; Vasudevan, Rama K.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Ctr Nanophase Mat Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Cao, Ye; Balke, Nina; Jesse, Stephen; Kalinin, Sergei V.; Vasudevan, Rama K.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Inst Funct Imaging Mat, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Naul, Brett] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Astron, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [van der Walt, Stefan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Inst Data Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Martin, Lane W.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Agar, JC; Martin, LW (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Martin, LW (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Div Mat Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jagar@berkeley.edu; lwmartin@berkeley.edu,"Martin, Lane W./H-2409-2011; Balke, Nina/Q-2505-2015; Vasudevan, Rama/Q-2530-2015","Martin, Lane W./0000-0003-1889-2513; Balke, Nina/0000-0001-5865-5892; Vasudevan, Rama/0000-0003-4692-8579; Agar, Joshua/0000-0001-5411-4693; Pandya, Shishir/0000-0002-7557-5947","Army Research Office [W911NF-14-1-0104]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Sciences and Engineering Division under Materials Project program KC23MPUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05-CH11231]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DMR-1708615, OISE-1545907, DMR-1451219]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC-0012375]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Data-Driven Discovery; NSF BIGDATA Grant [1251274]; Center for Nanophase Materials SciencesUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1451219] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Y.C. and B.N. contributed equally to this work.

We here introduce a statistical potential which considers moieties as fundamental units. The scoring function is able to deal with both folding and ligand pocket recognition problems with a performance comparable to the scoring functions specifically tailored for one of the two tasks. We foresee that the capability of the new scoring function to tackle both problems in a unified framework will be a key to deal with the induced fit phenomena, in which a target protein changes significantly its conformation upon binding. Moreover, the new scoring function might be useful in docking protocols towards intrinsically disordered proteins, whose flexibility cannot be handled with the available docking software.","[Battisti, Anna; Laio, Alessandro] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Zamuner, Stefano] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Inst Phys, Lab Stat Biophys, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sarti, Edoardo] NINDS, NIH, 35 Convent Dr, Bethesda, MD 20894 USA; [Laio, Alessandro] Abdus Salaam Int Ctr Theoret Phys, Str Costiera 11, I-34100 Trieste, Italy","Battisti, A (corresponding author), Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy.",battistianna@googlemail.com,"Laio, Alessandro/K-2117-2012","Laio, Alessandro/0000-0001-9164-7907; Zamuner, Stefano/0000-0003-1071-1829; Sarti, Edoardo/0000-0003-2417-1448",AIRC 5 per mille grant Application of Advanced Nanotechnology in the Development of Innovative Cancer Diagnostics ToolsAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC),"We thank F.

These conformational changes, often intimately connected to the functional roles that proteins play, may be obscured by traditional biophysical techniques. Over the past 40 years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have complemented these techniques by providing the hidden atomistic details that underlie protein dynamics. However, there are limitations of the degree to which molecular simulations accurately and quantitatively describe protein motions. Here we show that although four molecular dynamics simulation packages (AMBER, GROMACS, NAMD, and ilmm) reproduced a variety of experimental observables for two different proteins (engrailed homeodomain and RNase H) equally well overall at room temperature, there were subtle differences in the underlying conformational distributions and the extent of conformational sampling obtained. This leads to ambiguity about which results are correct, as experiment cannot always provide the necessary detailed information to distinguish between the underlying conformational ensembles. However, the results with different packages diverged more when considering larger amplitude motion, for example, the thermal unfolding process and conformational states sampled, with some packages failing to allow the protein to unfold at high temperature or providing results at odds with experiment. While most differences between MD simulations performed with different packages are attributed to the force fields themselves, there are many other factors that influence the outcome, including the water model, algorithms that constrain motion, how atomic interactions are handled, and the simulation ensemble employed. Here four different MD packages were tested each using best practices as established by the developers, utilizing three different protein force fields and three different water models. Differences between the simulated protein behavior using two different packages but the same force field, as well as two different packages with different force fields but the same water models and approaches to restraining motion, show how other factors can influence the behavior, and it is incorrect to place all the blame for deviations and errors on force fields or to expect improvements in force fields alone to solve such problems.","[Childers, Matthew Carter; Daggett, Valerie] Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Daggett, V (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Bioengn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",daggett@u.washington.edu,"Childers, Matthew C/N-6541-2016","Childers, Matthew C/0000-0003-2440-9612; daggett, valerie/0000-0002-5116-6102","DOE Office of Biological ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1548562]; Bioengineering Cardiovascular Training Grant [NIH/NIBIB T32EB1650]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERINGUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging & Bioengineering (NIBIB) [T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650, T32EB001650] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, supported by the DOE Office of Biological Research, which is supported by the US Department of Energy under Contract DE-AC02-05CH11231, for providing computing time.

PGK is a monomeric protein composed of two similar domains and has been the focus of many studies for investigating interdomain interactions within the native state and during folding. Previous studies used traditional biophysical methods (such as circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence, and NMR) to measure signals over a large ensemble of molecules, which made it difficult to observe transient changes in stability or structure during unfolding and refolding of single molecules. Here, we unfold single molecules of PGK using atomic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamic computer simulations to examine the conformational dynamics of PGK during its unfolding process. Our results show that after the initial forced separation of its domains, yeast PGK (yPGK) does not follow a single mechanical unfolding pathway; instead, it stochastically follows two distinct pathways: unfolding from the N-terminal domain or unfolding from the C-terminal domain. The truncated yPGK N-terminal domain unfolds via a transient intermediate, whereas the structurally similar isolated C-terminal domain has no detectable intermediates throughout its mechanical unfolding process. The N-terminal domain in the full-length yPGK displays a strong unfolding intermediate 13% of the time, whereas the truncated domain (yPGKNT) transitions through the intermediate 81% of the time. This effect indicates that the mechanical properties of yPGK cannot be simply deduced from the mechanical properties of its constituents. We also find that Escherichia coli PGK is significantly less mechanically stable as compared to yPGK, contrary to bulk unfolding measurements. Our results support the growing body of observations that the folding behavior of multidomain proteins is difficult to predict based solely on the studies of isolated domains.","[Li, Qing; Marszalek, Piotr E.] Duke Univ, Ctr Biol Inspired Mat & Mat Syst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Scholl, Zackary N.] Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Li, Q; Marszalek, PE (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Biol Inspired Mat & Mat Syst, Durham, NC 27708 USA.; Scholl, ZN (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Pratt Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn & Mat Sci, Program Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ql29@duke.edu; zns@duke.edu; pemar@duke.edu,"Li, Qing/AAE-5788-2019",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [GRFP 1106401, MCB-1517245]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1517245] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1517245] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",This work is supported by National Science Foundation grant GRFP 1106401 to Z.N.S. and by National Science Foundation grant MCB-1517245 to P.E.M.,,121,2,3,2,16,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

However, coarse models involve approximations that may affect their predictive power. We propose a modeling framework that allows us to design simplified models to accurately reproduce experimental observables. We demonstrate the approach on the folding mechanism of a WW domain. We show that when the correct coarsening resolution is used not only do the optimized models match the Reference model simulated experimental data accurately but additional observables not directly targeted during the optimization procedure are also reproduced. Additionally, the analysis of the results shows that localized frustration plays an important role in the folding mechanism of this protein and suggests that nontrivial aspects of the protein dynamics are evolutionary conserved.","[Chen, Justin] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Jiming; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Pinamonti, Giovanni; Clementi, Cecilia] Freie Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Chen, Justin; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Freie Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",cecilia@rice.edu,"Chen, Jiming/AAA-3575-2020","Chen, Jiming/0000-0003-3155-3145; Chen, Jiming/0000-0001-5232-5382; Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Einstein Foundation in Berlin; Big-Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]","We are grateful to D.

A powerful approach to analyze dynamics contained in such data sets is to describe/approximate it by diffusion on a free energy landscape - free energy as a function of reaction coordinates (RC). For the description to be quantitatively accurate, RCs should be chosen in an optimal way. Recent theoretical results show that such an optimal RC exists; however, determining it for practical systems is a very difficult unsolved problem. Here we describe a solution to this problem. We describe an adaptive nonparametric approach to accurately determine the optimal RC (the committor) for an equilibrium trajectory of a realistic system. In contrast to alternative approaches, which require a functional form with many parameters to approximate an RC and thus extensive expertise with the system, the suggested approach is nonparametric and can approximate any RC with high accuracy without system specific information. To avoid overfitting for a realistically sampled system, the approach performs RC optimization in an adaptive manner by focusing optimization on less optimized spatiotemporal regions of the RC. The power of the approach is illustrated on a long equilibrium atomistic folding simulation of HP35 protein. We have determined the optimal folding RC - the committor, which was confirmed by passing a stringent committor validation test. It allowed us to determine a first quantitatively accurate protein folding free energy landscape. We have confirmed the recent theoretical results that diffusion on such a free energy profile can be used to compute exactly the equilibrium flux, the mean first passage times, and the mean transition path times between any two points on the profile. We have shown that the mean squared displacement along the optimal RC grows linear with time as for simple diffusion. The free energy profile allowed us to obtain a direct rigorous estimate of the pre-exponential factor for the folding dynamics.","[Krivov, Sergei V.] Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Krivov, SV (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.krivov@leeds.ac.uk,,,BBSRCBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/J016055/1],The work has been partially supported by BBSRC Grant (No. BB/J016055/1).,,43,4,4,1,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

This is not only due to the small size of the structural change upon ligand binding to an allosteric site, but also due to challenges in designing experiments that directly observe such an allosteric transition. On the basis of recent pump-probe-type experiments (Buchli et al. 2013 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 110, 11 725-11 730.

That is, calculating the dynamical content of both experiment and simulation (which agree remarkably well with each other), we find that allosteric communication shares some properties with downhill folding, except that it is an 'order-order' transition. Discussing themultiscale and hierarchical features of the dynamics, the validity of linear response theory as well as the meaning of 'allosteric pathways', we conclude that non-equilibrium experiments and simulations are a promising way to study dynamical aspects of allostery.

Recent work in the field of deep learning has led to the development of the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is able to compress complex datasets into simpler manifolds. We present the use of a time-lagged VAE, or variational dynamics encoder (VDE), to reduce complex, nonlinear processes to a single embedding with high fidelity to the underlying dynamics. We demonstrate how the VDE is able to capture nontrivial dynamics in a variety of examples, including Brownian dynamics and atomistic protein folding. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for analyzing the VDE model, inspired by saliency mapping, to determine what features are selected by the VDE model to describe dynamics.

By combining high-throughput MD with Markov state models (MSMs), it is now possible to obtain long time-scale behavior of small to intermediate biomolecules and complexes. To model the interactions of many molecules at large length scales, particle-based reaction-diffusion (RD) simulations are more suitable but lack molecular detail. Thus, coupling MSMs and RD simulations (MSM/RD) would be highly desirable, as they could efficiently produce simulations at large time and length scales, while still conserving the characteristic features of the interactions observed at atomic detail. While such a coupling seems straightforward, fundamental questions are still open: Which definition of MSM states is suitable? Which protocol to merge and split RD particles in an association/dissociation reaction will conserve the correct bimolecular kinetics and thermodynamics? In this paper, we make the first step toward MSM/RD by laying out a general theory of coupling and proposing a first implementation for association/dissociation of a protein with a small ligand (A + B reversible arrow C).

No previous information, not even approximated, on the path followed during the transition is needed. The only requirement is to know the fluctuations of the system while in the two metastable states. With this information in hand, we build the collective variable using a modified version of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The usefulness of this approach is tested on the metadynamics simulation of two representative systems. The first is the freezing of silver iodide into the supertonic alpha-phase, and the second is the study of a classical Diels-Alder reaction. The collective variable works very well in these two diverse cases.","[Mendels, Dan; Piccini, GiovanniMaria; Parrinello, Michele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, USI Campus,Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland; [Mendels, Dan; Piccini, GiovanniMaria; Parrinello, Michele] Univ Svizzera Italiana USI, Ist Sci Computaz, Fac Informat, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland","Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, USI Campus,Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland.; Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana USI, Ist Sci Computaz, Fac Informat, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland.",parrinello@phys.chem.ethz.ch,"Piccini, GiovanniMaria/N-6800-2018","Mendels, Dan/0000-0002-2408-3133",European Union Grant [ERC-2014-AdG-670227/VARMET],This research was supported by the European Union Grant No. ERC-2014-AdG-670227/VARMET.

It allows users to visualize and sample, with atomic-level precision, the structures and dynamics of complex molecular structures on the fly and to interact with other users in the same virtual environment. A series of controlled studies, in which participants were tasked with a range of molecular manipulation goals (threading methane through a nanotube, changing helical screw sense, and tying a protein knot), quantitatively demonstrate that users within the interactive VR environment can complete sophisticated molecular modeling tasks more quickly than they can using conventional interfaces, especially for molecular pathways and structural transitions whose conformational choreographies are intrinsically three-dimensional. This framework should accelerate progress in nanoscale molecular engineering areas including conformational mapping, drug development, synthetic biology, and catalyst design. More broadly, our findings highlight the potential of VR in scientific domains where three-dimensional dynamics matter, spanning research and education.","[O'Connor, Michael; Deeks, Helen M.; Dawn, Edward; Thomas, Lisa May; Mulholland, Adrian J.; Glowacki, David R.] Univ Bristol, Ctr Computat Chem, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England; [O'Connor, Michael; Deeks, Helen M.; Metatla, Oussama; Roudaut, Anne; Sutton, Matthew; Thomas, Lisa May; Glowacki, David R.] Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Merchant Venturers Bldg, Bristol BS8 1UB, Avon, England; [O'Connor, Michael; Thomas, Lisa May; Glowacki, Becca Rose; Sage, Rebecca; Tew, Philip; Glowacki, David R.] Pervas Media Studio, 1 Canons Rd, Bristol BS1 5TX, Avon, England; [Thomas, Lisa May] Univ Bristol, Dept Theatre, Bristol BS8 1UP, Avon, England; [Glowacki, Becca Rose] Univ West England, Sch Art & Design, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Sage, Rebecca; Tew, Philip; Wonnacott, Mark] Interact Sci, Engine Shed, Stn Approach, Bristol BS1 6QH, Avon, England; [Bates, Phil] Oracle Cloud Dev Ctr, Tower Wharf,Cheese Lane, Bristol BS2 2JJ, Avon, England","Glowacki, DR (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Ctr Computat Chem, Sch Chem, Bristol BS8 1TS, Avon, England.; Glowacki, DR (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Comp Sci, Merchant Venturers Bldg, Bristol BS8 1UB, Avon, England.; Glowacki, DR (corresponding author), Pervas Media Studio, 1 Canons Rd, Bristol BS1 5TX, Avon, England.",glowacki@bristol.ac.uk,,"Tew, Phill/0000-0002-0991-9596; Thomas, Lisa May/0000-0002-6960-5740; Mulholland, Adrian/0000-0003-1015-4567; Metatla, Oussama/0000-0002-3882-3243; O'Connor, Mike/0000-0001-8047-1221; Sage, Rebecca/0000-0003-2168-5814","industrial CASE; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Interactive Scientific; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Oracle Corporation (University Partnership Cloud Award); Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London [UF120381]; EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/P021123/1, EP/P004342/1, EP/M022609/1, EP/N00616X/2]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust; London Barbican; UFI Charitable Trust","M.O.'s studentship (supervised by D.R.G.) is supported through an industrial CASE, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and Interactive Scientific.

In PaCS-MD, initial structures relevant to conformational transitions are reasonably selected by referring to a set of reaction coordinates (RCs), and short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are independently launched from them. To efficiently perform PaCS-MD, specifications of RCs are essential, but specifying reasonable RCs is generally nontrivial. In the present study, we propose on-the-fly specifications of RCs as an extended PaCS-MD. In the present method, n types of RCs are provided as candidates a priori as follows: RC = (X-1, X-2, ..., X-n), and one of the RCs is specified in a cycle-dependent manner, i.e. the reasonable RC is searched at every cycle by evaluating gradients of the RCs, i.e. RC with the steepest gradient for cycle is regarded as the reasonable RC, and conformational resampling proceeds along it, promoting conformational transition of a given protein. For a demonstration, the extended PaCS-MD was applied to reproduce the open-closed conformational transition of T4 lysozyme (T4L). As candidates of possible RCs, (1) root-mean square distance, (2) principal coordinates, (3) accessible surface area, (4) radius of gyration, and (5) end-to-end distance were adopted in the cycle-dependent specifications of RCs. Through the demonstration, the extended PaCS-MD successfully reproduced the conformational transition from the open to closed states of T4L. As a more complicated practice, a dimerization process of diubiquitin was efficiently reproduced with the extended PaCS-MD, showing the high conformational sampling efficiency of the present algorithm. In contrast, the conventional PaCS-MD with a fixed RC sometimes failed to generate a set of reactive trajectories when an unreasonable RC was specified, i.e. the conformational sampling efficiency of PaCS-MD might more or less depend on the specified RCs. Judging from the present demonstrations, on-the-fly specifications of RCs might be effective in reproducing/predicting essential transitions of a given protein.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Asuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, A (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H06164]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP26102525, JP26107004, JP26105012]; Initiative on Promotion of Supercomputing for Young or Women Researchers, Information Technology Center, The University of Tokyo; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center at Tokyo Institute of Technology","The present work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (No. JP16H06164) and by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Dynamic Ordering and Biofunction, Photosynergetics, and 3D Active-Site Science (Nos.

In this paper, we extend the methodology toward efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states is found in both the wild type (baseline) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by recapturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-ILDN. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the effects of the GTT mutation on the FIP35 WW domain.","[Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, 318 Campus Dr, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",Pande@stanford.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF-MCB-0954714]; National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [ACI-1429830]; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1429830] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors would like to thank various members of the Pande lab for useful discussions and feedback on the manuscript.

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-theart force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation.

In order to accurately study this mechanism, the scientific community needs a crystal structure of the Wild type AR (WT-AR) ligand binding domain, bound with antagonist. To address this open need, we leveraged molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to construct a structure of the WT-AR ligand binding domain bound with antagonist bicalutamide. The structure of mutant AR (Mut-AR) bound with this same antagonist informed this study. After molecular docking analysis pinpointed the suitable binding orientation of a ligand in AR, the model was further optimized through 1 mu s of MD simulations. Using this approach, three molecular systems were studied: (1) WTAR bound with agonist R1881, (2) WT-AR bound with antagonist bicalutamide, and (3) Mut-AR bound with bicalutamide. Our structures were very similar to the experimentally determined structures of both WT-AR with R1881 and Mut-AR with bicalutamide, demonstrating the trustworthiness of this approach. In our model, when WT-AR is bound with bicalutamide, Val716/Lys720/Gln733, or Met734/Gln738/Glu897 move and thus disturb the positive and negative charge clumps of the AF2 site. This disruption of the AF2 site is key for understanding the impact of antagonist binding on subsequent coregulator binding. In conclusion, the antagonist induced structural changes in WT-AR detailed in this study will enable further AR research and will facilitate AR targeting drug discovery.","[Sakkiah, Sugunadevi; Pan, Bohu; Guo, Wenjing; Ge, Weigong; Tong, Weida; Hong, Huixiao] US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA; [Kusko, Rebecca] Immuneering Corp, Cambridge, MA USA","Hong, HX (corresponding author), US FDA, Div Bioinformat & Biostat, Natl Ctr Toxicol Res, Jefferson, AR 72079 USA.",huixiao.hong@fda.hhs.gov,,,Research Participation Program at the National Center for Toxicological Research,"This research was supported in part by an appointment to the Research Participation Program at the National Center for Toxicological Research (SS, BP, and WGo) administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",,82,8,8,5,18,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1663-9812,,,FRONT PHARMACOL,Front.

Using all-atom simulations based on the recently developed bias functional algorithm, we elucidate how wildtype alpha(1)-antitrypsin folds and how the disease-associated S (Glu264Val) and Z (Glu342Lys) mutations lead to misfolding. The deleterious Z mutation disrupts folding at an early stage, whereas the relatively benign S mutant shows late-stage minor misfolding. A number of suppressor mutations ameliorate the effects of the Z mutation, and simulations on these mutants help to elucidate the relative roles of steric clashes and electrostatic interactions in Z misfolding. These results demonstrate a striking correlation between atomistic events and disease severity and shine light on the mechanisms driving chains away from their correct folding routes.","[Wang, Fang; Wintrode, Patrick L.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Orioli, Simone; Ianeselli, Alan; Spagnolli, Giovanni; Beccara, Silvio A.; Faccioli, Pietro] Univ Trento, Dipartimento Fis, Povo, Trento, Italy; [Orioli, Simone; Ianeselli, Alan; Spagnolli, Giovanni; Beccara, Silvio A.; Faccioli, Pietro] Trento Inst Fundamental Phys & Applicat, Povo, Trento, Italy; [Gershenson, Anne] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Wintrode, PL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.; Faccioli, P (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dipartimento Fis, Povo, Trento, Italy.; Faccioli, P (corresponding author), Trento Inst Fundamental Phys & Applicat, Povo, Trento, Italy.; Gershenson, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gershenson@biochem.umass.edu; pietro.faccioli@unitn.it; pwintrod@rx.umaryland.edu,"Faccioli, Pietro/AAF-1499-2019","Faccioli, Pietro/0000-0003-1849-6692; Spagnolli, Giovanni/0000-0002-0578-0558; Gershenson, Anne/0000-0003-3124-9610","Alpha-1 Foundation; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM094848]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM094848, R01GM094848, R01GM094848, R01GM094848, R01GM094848] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was funded by the Alpha-1 Foundation (P.L.W. and P.F.) and National Institutes of Health grant GM094848 (A.G.).,,62,6,6,0,10,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

So far, geometric order parameters, such as the root mean square deviation, fraction of native amino acid contacts, and collective coordinates that best characterize rare or large conformational transitions, have been prevailing in protein folding studies. Here, we show that the solvent-averaged effective energy, which is a thermodynamic quantity but unambiguously defined for individual protein conformations, serves as a good order parameter of protein folding. This is illustrated through the application to the folding-unfolding simulation trajectory of villin headpiece subdomain. We rationalize the suitability of the effective energy as an order parameter by the funneledness of the underlying protein free energy landscape. We also demonstrate that an improved conformational space discretization is achieved by incorporating the effective energy. The most distinctive feature of this thermodynamic order parameter is that it works in pointing to near-native folded structures even when the knowledge of the native structure is lacking, and the use of the effective energy will also find applications in combination with methods of protein structure prediction.","[Chong, Song-Ho; Ham, Sihyun] Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea","Ham, S (corresponding author), Sookmyung Womens Univ, Dept Chem, Cheongpa Ro 47 Gil 100, Seoul 04310, South Korea.",sihyun@sookmyung.ac.kr,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341, 2017R1A2B3010053]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Nos NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058341 and 2017R1A2B3010053).

The former provide time series data, such as donor-acceptor distances, whereas the latter give atomistic information, although this information is often biased by model parameters. Here, we devise a machine-learning method to combine the complementary information from the two approaches and construct a consistent model of conformational dynamics. It is applied to the folding dynamics of the forminbinding protein WW domain. MD simulations over 400 mu s led to an initial Markov state model (MSM), which was then refined using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) data through hidden Markov modeling. The refined or data-assimilated MSM reproduces the FRET data and features hairpin one in the transition-state ensemble, consistent with mutation experiments. The folding pathway in the data-assimilated MSM suggests interplay between hydrophobic contacts and turn formation. Our method provides a general framework for investigating conformational transitions in other proteins.","[Matsunaga, Yasuhiro; Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN Ctr Computat Sci, Computat Biophys Res Team, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Matsunaga, Yasuhiro] JST PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Japan; [Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN Cluster Pioneering Res, Theoret Mol Sci Lab, Wako, Saitama, Japan; [Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res, Lab Biomol Funct Simulat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan","Sugita, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN Ctr Computat Sci, Computat Biophys Res Team, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.; Sugita, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN Cluster Pioneering Res, Theoret Mol Sci Lab, Wako, Saitama, Japan.; Sugita, Y (corresponding author), RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res, Lab Biomol Funct Simulat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",sugita@riken.jp,"Matsunaga, Yasuhiro/C-6774-2016; Sugita, Yuji/L-6726-2014","Matsunaga, Yasuhiro/0000-0003-2872-3908; Sugita, Yuji/0000-0001-9738-9216","Japan Science and Technology AgencyJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJPR1679, JPMJCR13M3]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [26120533, 26119006]; RIKEN; Research Organization for Information Science and Technology [hp160022, ra000009]","Japan Science and Technology Agency JPMJPR1679 Yasuhiro Matsunaga; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology 26120533 Yasuhiro Matsunaga; RIKEN Dynamic Structural Biology Yuji Sugita; Research Organization for Information Science and Technology hp160022 Yasuhiro Matsunaga Yuji Sugita; Japan Science and Technology Agency JPMJCR13M3 Yuji Sugita; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology 26119006 Yuji Sugita; Research Organization for Information Science and Technology ra000009 Yasuhiro Matsunaga Yuji Sugita; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,93,8,8,0,17,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,May-03,2018,7,,,,,,,,e32668,10.7554/eLife.32668,,,19,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,GE5UQ,WOS:000431288400001,29723137,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Large active forces lead to large accelerations, requiring subfemtosecond integration time steps to capture the resultant high-frequency vibrations. It is often necessary to combine these fast dynamics with larger scale phenomena, creating a multiscale problem. A multiscale method has been previously shown to greatly reduce the time required to simulate systems in the continuum regime. A new multiscale formulation is proposed to extend the continuum formulation to the atomistic scale. A canonical ensemble model is defined using a modified Nose-Hoover thermostat to maintain the constant temperature constraint.

We here provide a comprehensive overview of the fast-developing field of MD simulations of RNA molecules. We begin with an in-depth, evaluatory coverage of the most fundamental methodological challenges that set the basis for the future development of the field, in particular, the current developments and inherent physical limitations of the atomistic force fields and the recent advances in a broad spectrum of enhanced sampling methods. We also survey the closely related field of coarse-grained modeling of RNA systems. After dealing with the methodological aspects, we provide an exhaustive overview of the available RNA simulation literature, ranging from studies of the smallest RNA oligonucleotides to investigations of the entire ribosome. Our review encompasses tetranucleotides, tetraloops, a number of small RNA motifs, A-helix RNA, kissing-loop complexes, the TAR RNA element, the decoding center and other important regions of the ribosome, as well as assorted others systems. Extended sections are devoted to RNA-ion interactions, ribozymes, riboswitches, and protein/RNA complexes.

The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique 3D structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional unit is a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces that also makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological conditions. The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a powerful tool for studies of individual biomolecules and their functional assemblies, encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However, advances in parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of the underlying theoretical modelsthe molecular force fields, pushing the MD method into an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have found the most commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance, overestimating attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic groups, which can promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of multi-component protein, nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route towards improving the force fields is through the NBFIX corrections method, in which the intermolecular forces are calibrated against experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic pressure by making atom pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded interactions. In this article, we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded FIX) corrections to the AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their implications for MD simulations of electrolyte solutions, dense DNA systems, Holliday junctions, protein folding, and lipid bilayer membranes.","[Yoo, Jejoong; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Ctr Phys Living Cells, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yoo, Jejoong; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Yoo, Jejoong] Inst for Basic Sci Korea, Ctr Self Assembly & Complex, Pohang 37363, South Korea","Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Ctr Phys Living Cells, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",aksiment@illinois.edu,"Yoo, Jejoong/G-5957-2010","Yoo, Jejoong/0000-0001-7120-8464; Aksimentiev, Aleksei/0000-0002-6042-8442","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1430124]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41-GM104601]; Institute for Basic Science [IBS-R007-Y1]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the grants from the National Science Foundation (PHY-1430124) and the National Institutes of Health (P41-GM104601).

The highly dynamic properties and conformational heterogeneity of IDPs make them challenging to study with traditional experimental techniques. As a powerful complementary tool for experiments, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation can obtain detailed conformational information on IDPs, but the limitation of force field accuracy is a challenge for reproducing IDP conformers. Here, we compared five empirical all-atom force fields AMBER03, AMBER99SB-ILDN, CHARMM27, OPLS-AA/L and CHARMM36m in modeling the conformational ensembles of wild-type peptide TAD2(41-62) from the human p53 tumor suppressor. Our results show that for the model peptide, the newest force field CHARMM36m produces more expanded coil ensemble followed by AMBER99SB-ILDN; CHARMM27 displays a predominant propensity for a helical structure; whereas OPLS-AA/L exhibits a apparent preference for a beta-sheet structure and yields the most compact conformation. In the comparison of the simulated dimensions with theoretical prediction and the back-calculated chemical shifts with experimental measurements, AMBER99SB-ILDN gives a more consistent agreement than the other force fields. In addition, the region from residues 47 to 55, which commonly forms an amphipathic a-helix upon binding target proteins according to experimental observation, could form a helical structure with a different probability population in our simulations with different force fields. This implies that the binding process might be conducted by, or partly by conformation selection'' for this peptide. This work indicates that force field development for modeling general IDPs accurately has a long way to go, and more detailed experimental data of IDPs are also in demand.","[Ouyang, Yanhua; Zhao, Likun; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,"Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X; Zhao, Likun/0000-0003-3817-2329","National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21633001, 31200548]","We thank Prof. Jizhong Lou for his helpful discussion, and Miss Keqi Xiang for her assistance in initial model building.

Here, we present a detailed analysis of 150,000 folding transition paths of five proteins at three different thermodynamic conditions from an experimentally consistent statistical mechanical model. We find that the underlying TSE structural distributions are rarely unimodal, and the average experimental measures arise from complex underlying distributions. Unfolding pathways also exhibit subtle differences from folding counterparts due to a combination of Hammond behavior and native-state movements. Local interactions and topological complexity, to a lesser extent, are found to determine pathway heterogeneity, underscoring the importance of the balance between local and nonlocal energetics in protein folding.","[Gopi, Soundhararajan; Naganathan, Athi N.] Indian Inst Technol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Paul, Suvadip; Ranu, Sayan] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India","Naganathan, AN (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Madras 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",athi@iitm.ac.in,,"Naganathan, Athi N/0000-0002-1655-7802; Gopi, Soundhara Rajan/0000-0002-7511-2571",,,,45,3,3,2,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1948-7185,,,J PHYS CHEM LETT,J.

We further provide a simple extension to variational dynamics encoders that allows the model to be trained in a more efficient manner on larger systems by encoding the outputs of a linear transformation using time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA). Using this technique, we show how such a model trained for one protein, the WW domain, can efficiently be transferred to perform enhanced sampling on a related mutant protein, the GTT mutation.

Measurement of short range dipolar CCR rates has been demonstrated for a variety of inter-nuclear vector spin pairs in proteins and nucleic acids, where the multiple quantum coherence necessary for observing the CCR rate is created by through-bond scalar coupling. In principle, CCR rates can be measured for any pair of inter-nuclear vectors where coherence can be generated between one spin of each spin pair, regardless of both the distance between the two spin pairs and the distance of the two spins forming the multiple quantum coherence. In practice, however, long range CCR (lrCCR) rates are challenging to measure due to difficulties in linking spatially distant spin pairs. By utilizing through-space relaxation allowed coherence transfer (RACT), we have developed a new method for the measurement of lrCCR rates involving C alpha H alpha bonds on opposing anti-parallel beta-strands. The resulting lrCCR rates are straightforward to interpret since only the angle between the two vectors modulates the strength of the interference effect. We applied our lrCCR measurement to the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of the streptococcal protein G (GB3) and utilize published NMR ensembles and static NMR/X-ray structures to highlight the relationship between the lrCCR rates and the C alpha H alpha-C alpha H alpha inter-bond angle and bond mobility. Furthermore, we employ the lrCCR rates to guide the selection of sub-ensembles from the published NMR ensembles for enhancing the structural and dynamic interpretation of the data. We foresee this methodology for measuring lrCCR rates as improving the generation of structural ensembles by providing highly accurate details concerning the orientation of CaHa bonds on opposing anti-parallel beta-strands.","[Sabo, T.

This work continues to improve the acceleration power and energy reweighting of the GaMD by combining the GaMD with replica exchange algorithms. Two versions of replica exchange GaMD (rex-GaMD) are presented: force constant rex-GaMD and threshold energy rex-GaMD. During simulations of force constant rex-GaMD, the boost potential can be exchanged between replicas of different harmonic force constants with fixed threshold energy. However, the algorithm of threshold energy rex-GaMD tends to switch the threshold energy between lower and upper bounds for generating different levels of boost potential. Testing simulations on three model systems, including the alanine dipeptide, chignolin, and HIV protease, demonstrate that through continuous exchanges of the boost potential, the rex-GaMD simulations not only enhance the conformational transitions of the systems but also narrow down the distribution width of the applied boost potential for accurate energetic reweighting to recover biomolecular free energy profiles.","[Huang, Yu-ming M.; McCammon, J.

PKs propagate biochemical signals by catalyzing phosphorylation of other proteins, including other PKs, which can undergo conformational changes upon phosphorylation and catalyze further phosphorylations. Although PKs have been studied thoroughly across the domains of life, the structures of these proteins are sparsely understood in numerous groups of organisms, including plants. In addition to efforts towards determining crystal structures of PKs, research on human PKs has incorporated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the conformational dynamics underlying the switching of PK function. This approach of experimental structural biology coupled with computational biophysics has led to improved understanding of how PKs become catalytically active and why mutations cause pathological PK behavior, at spatial and temporal resolutions inaccessible to current experimental methods alone. In this review, we argue for the value of applying MD simulation to plant PKs. We review the basics of MD simulation methodology, the successes achieved through MD simulation in animal PKs, and current work on plant PKs using MD simulation.

However, CD spectra are also sensitive to the 3D arrangement of the chain as a result of the excitonic nature of additional signals due to the aromatic residues. This double sensitivity, when extended to time resolved experiments, should allow protein folding to be monitored with high spatial resolution. To date, the exploitation of this very appealing idea has been limited, due to the difficulty in relating the observed spectral evolution to specific configurations of the chain. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the folding pathways with a quantum chemical evaluation of the excitonic spectra provides the missing key. This is exemplified for the folding of canine milk lysozyme protein.","[Ianeselli, Alan; Spagnolli, Giovanni] Trento Univ, Ctr Integrat Biol, Via Sommar 9, I-38128 Povo, Trento, Italy; [Orioli, Simone; Faccioli, Pietro] Trento Univ, Phys Dept, Via Sommar 14, I-38128 Povo, Trento, Italy; [Cupellini, Lorenzo; Jurinovich, Sandro; Mennucci, Benedetta] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Chim & Chim Ind, Via G Moruzzi 13, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Orioli, Simone; Faccioli, Pietro] Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, TIFPA, Via Sommar 14, I-38128 Povo, Trento, Italy","Mennucci, B (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Chim & Chim Ind, Via G Moruzzi 13, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.; Faccioli, P (corresponding author), Ist Nazl Fis Nucl, TIFPA, Via Sommar 14, I-38128 Povo, Trento, Italy.",pietro.faccioli@unitn.it; benedetta.mennucci@unipi.it,"Cupellini, Lorenzo/O-2324-2014; Faccioli, Pietro/AAF-1499-2019; Mennucci, Benedetta/G-5522-2016","Cupellini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0848-2908; Faccioli, Pietro/0000-0003-1849-6692; Spagnolli, Giovanni/0000-0002-0578-0558; Mennucci, Benedetta/0000-0002-4394-0129",,,,78,15,15,4,22,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0002-7863,,,J AM CHEM SOC,J.

But how well can force fields developed independently of implicit solvent models work together in reproducing diverse protein native structures and measuring the corresponding folding thermodynamics is not always clear. In this work, we performed enhanced sampling MD simulations to assess the ability of six AMBER force fields (FF99SBiIdn, FF99SBnmr, FF12SB, FF14ipq, FF14SB, and FF14SBonlysc) as coupled with a recently improved pair-wise GB-Neck2 model in modeling the folding of two helical and two 1-sheet peptides. Whilst most of the tested force fields can yield roughly similar features for equilibrium conformational ensembles and detailed folding free-energy profiles for short a-helical TC10b in an implicit solvent, the measured counterparts are significantly discrepant in the cases of larger or beta-structured peptides (HP35, 1E0Q, and GTT). Additionally, the calculated folding/unfolding thermodynamic quantities can only partially match the experimental data. Although a combination of the force fields and GB-Neck2 implicit model able to describe all aspects of the folding transitions towards the native structures of all the considered peptides was not identified, we found that FF14SBonlysc coupled with the GB-Neck2 model seems to be a reasonably balanced combination to predict peptide folding preferences.","[Shao, Oiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China","Shao, O (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFA0502301]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund [U1501501],"This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No. 2016YFA0502301), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501.

Their specificity is essential for cellular signaling pathways. We studied the binding of the Tiam1 PDZ domain to peptides derived from the C-termini of its Syndecan-1 and Caspr4 targets. We used free energy perturbation (FEP) to characterize the binding energetics of one wild-type and 17 mutant complexes by simulating 21 alchemical transformations between pairs of complexes. Thirteen complexes had known experimental affinities. FEP is a powerful tool to understand protein/ligand binding. It depends, however, on the accuracy of molecular dynamics force fields and conformational sampling. Both aspects require continued testing, especially for ionic mutations. For six mutations that did not modify the net charge, we obtained excellent agreement with experiment using the additive, AMBER ff99SB force field, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.37 kcal/mol. For six ionic mutations that modified the net charge, agreement was also good, with one large error (3 kcal/mol) and an RMSD of 0.9 kcal/mol for the other five. The large error arose from the overstabilization of a protein/peptide salt bridge by the additive force field. Four of the ionic mutations were also simulated with the polarizable Drude force field, which represents the first test of this force field for protein/ligand binding free energy changes. The large error was eliminated and the RMS error for the four mutations was reduced from 1.8 to 1.2 kcal/mol. The overall accuracy of FEP indicates it can be used to understand PDZ/peptide binding. Importantly, our results show that for ionic mutations in buried regions, electronic polarization plays a significant role.","[Panel, Nicolas; Villa, Francesco; Simonson, Thomas] Ecole Polytech, Lab

The extent of the impact of hydrodynamic interactions, whether it accelerates, retards, or has no effect on protein folding, has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework of the energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein folding that describes the dynamics of the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a folding barrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the folding rates of two protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a 64-residue alpha/beta chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) protein, and a 57-residue beta-barrel alpha-spectrin Src-homology 3 domain (SH3) protein. When comparing the protein folding kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein folding appears to have a crossover behavior about the folding temperature. This means that at a temperature greater than the folding temperature, the enhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an unfolded configuration results in lowered folding rate; conversely, at a temperature lower than the folding temperature, HI accelerates folding by the backflow of solvent toward the folded configuration of a protein. Additionally, the extent of acceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI2, where its folding nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels the formation of contacts by favoring a major folding pathway in a complex free energy landscape, thus accelerating folding. For a protein like SH3, where its folding nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a temperature lower than the folding temperature. Our findings provide further theoretical insight to protein folding kinetic experiments and simulations.","[Zegarra, Fabio C.; Homouz, Dirar; Eliaz, Yossi; Gasic, Andrei G.; Cheung, Margaret S.] Univ Houston, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Zegarra, Fabio C.; Homouz, Dirar; Eliaz, Yossi; Gasic, Andrei G.; Cheung, Margaret S.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Homouz, Dirar] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, POB 127788, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Cheung, MS (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77204 USA.; Cheung, MS (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",mscheung@uh.edu,,"Zegarra Choque, Fabio/0000-0002-7113-5100","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB: 1412532, ACI: 1531814, PHY: 1427654]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280, T32GM008280] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412532] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1412532] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","We thank the members from the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics (CTBP) at Rice University and Dr. Greg Morrison for stimulating discussions.

We give a brief overview of several distinct classes of available water models, with the emphasis on the conceptual basis at each level of approximation. The main focus is on classes of models most widely used in atomistic simulations, including popular implicit and explicit solvent models. Among the latter, nonpolarizable N-point models are covered in most detail, including some recent methodological advances and nuances. Notes on practical availability and usage in biomolecular simulations are included. Atomistic simulations that were hardly possible only a short while ago have revealed significant problems that can be traced to deficiencies of most commonly used N-point water models. Recently developed models of this class approximate experimental properties of liquid water much closer than before, and show promise in practical biomolecular simulations. Obstacles to wider adoption of these more accurate water models, both technical and conceptual, are discussed. It is argued that verifying robustness of simulation results to the choice of water model can be of immediate benefit even in the absence of a clear replacement for older models; a specific strategy is proposed. The review is concluded with a discussion on how force-field development efforts can benefit from better solvent models, and vice versa.

Optimum force field selection for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the biophysical relevance of results are still unknown. We compared the conformational space of the A beta(1-40) dimers by 300 ns replica exchange MD simulations at physiological temperature (310 K) using: the AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb*-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, and CHARMM22* force fields. Statistical comparisons of simulation results to experimental data and previously published simulations utilizing the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields were performed. All force fields yield sampled ensembles of conformations with collision cross sectional areas for the dimer that are statistically significantly larger than experimental results. All force fields, with the exception of AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN (8.8 +/- 66.4%) and CHARMM36 (2.7 +/- 64.2%), tend to overestimate the a-helical content compared to experimental CD (5.3 +/- 65.2%). Using the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field resulted in the greatest degree of variance (41.3 +/- 612.9%). Except for the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field, the others tended to under estimate the expected amount of beta-sheet and over estimate the amount of turn/bend/random coil conformations. All force fields, with the exception AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, reproduce a theoretically expected beta-sheet-turn-beta-sheet conformational motif, however, only the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields yield results compatible with collapse of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic cores from residues 17-21 and 30-36. Although analyses of essential subspace sampling showed only minor variations between force fields, secondary structures of lowest energy conformers are different.","[Watts, Charles R.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Dept Neurosurg, Rochester, MN USA; [Watts, Charles R.; Gregory, Andrew; Frisbie, Cole] Mayo Clin Hlth Syst, Dept Neurosurg, La Crosse, WI USA; [Frisbie, Cole; Lovas, Sandor] Creighton Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Omaha, NE 68178 USA","Lovas, S (corresponding author), Creighton Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Omaha, NE 68178 USA.",slovas@creighton.edu,"Watts, Charles R./AAK-9849-2020","Watts, Charles R./0000-0002-5011-487X",Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare Foundation; Mayo Clinic-Mayo Foundation,Funding for this study is being provided in part through a grant from Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare Foundation and The Mayo Clinic-Mayo Foundation.,,128,9,10,3,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0887-3585,1097-0134,,PROTEINS,Proteins,MAR,2018,86,3,,,,,279,300,,10.1002/prot.25439,,,22,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biophysics,FV8NT,WOS:000424844300002,29235155,,,,19/11/2020

The application of such simulations to RNA structures, however, has proven more challenging, due in large part to the fact that the physical models (force fields) available for MD simulations of RNA molecules are substantially less accurate in many respects than those currently available for proteins. Here, we introduce an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the parameters have been modified, based on quantum mechanical calculations and existing experimental information, to more accurately reflect the fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including singlestranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations exhibited dramatically improved agreementwith experimentally determined values. Based on the comparisons we performed, this RNA force field appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields, thus significantly advancing the utility of MD simulation as a tool for elucidating the structural dynamics and function of RNA molecules and RNA-containing biological assemblies.","[Tan, Dazhi; Piana, Stefano; Dirks, Robert M.; Shaw, David E.] DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Shaw, David E.] Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Tan, Dazhi] Silicon Therapeut, Boston, MA 02210 USA","Piana, S; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), DE Shaw Res, New York, NY 10036 USA.; Shaw, DE (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biophys, New York, NY 10032 USA.",Stefano.Piana-Agostinetti@DEShawResearch.com; David.Shaw@DEShawResearch.com,,,,,,75,65,65,4,36,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Here we use continuous constant pH molecular dynamics in explicit solvent with pH replica exchange to describe the pH profile of the folding cooperativity of a miniprotein BBL, which has drawn intense debate in the past. Our data reconciled the two opposing hypotheses (downhill vs. two-state) and uncovered a sparsely populated unfolding intermediate. As pH is lowered from 7 to 5, the folding barrier vanishes. As pH continues to decrease, the unfolding barrier lowers and denaturation is triggered by the protonation of Asp162, consistent with experimental evidence. Interestingly, unfolding proceeded via an intermediate, with intact secondary structure and a compact, unlocked hydrophobic core shielded from solvent, lending support to the recent hypothesis of a universal dry molten globule in protein folding. Our work demonstrates that constant pH molecular dynamics is a unique tool for testing this and other hypotheses to advance the knowledge in protein dynamics, stability, and folding.","[Yue, Zhi; Shen, Jana] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA","Shen, J (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",jana.shen@rx.umaryland.edu,"Yue, Zhi/X-5819-2019","Yue, Zhi/0000-0002-4231-7474","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB1305560]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM098818]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818, R01GM098818] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The authors acknowledge National Science Foundation (MCB1305560) and National Institutes of Health (GM098818) for funding.,,67,6,6,0,10,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

The size and model complexity of MD simulations are rapidly growing along with increasing computing power and improved algorithms. This growth has led to the production of a large amount of simulation data that need to be filtered for relevant information to address specific biomedical and biochemical questions. One of the most relevant molecular properties that can be investigated by all-atom MD simulations is the time-dependent evolution of the complex noncovalent interaction networks governing such fundamental aspects as molecular recognition, binding strength, and mechanical and structural stability. Extracting, evaluating, and visualizing noncovalent interactions is a key task in the daily work of structural biologists. We have developed PyContact, an easy-to-use, highly flexible, and intuitive graphical user interface-based application, designed to provide a toolkit to investigate biomolecular interactions in MD trajectories. PyContact is designed to facilitate this task by enabling identification of relevant noncovalent interactions in a comprehensible manner. The implementation of PyContact as a standalone application enables rapid analysis and data visualization without any additional programming requirements, and also preserves full in-program customization and extension capabilities for advanced users. The statistical analysis representation is interactively combined with full mapping of the results on the molecular system through the synergistic connection between PyContact and VMD. We showcase the capabilities and scientific significance of PyContact by analyzing and visualizing in great detail the noncovalent interactions underlying the ion permeation pathway of the human P2X(3) receptor. As a second application, we examine the protein-protein interaction network of the mechanically ultrastable cohesin-dockering complex.","[Scheurer, Maximilian; Bernardi, Rafael C.; Schulten, Klaus; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Rudack, Till] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Scheurer, Maximilian; Rodenkirch, Peter; Siggel, Marc] Heidelberg Univ, Biochem Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany; [Scheurer, Maximilian] Interdisciplinary Ctr Sci Comp, Heidelberg, Germany; [Tajkhorshid, Emad] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rudack, Till] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Biophys, Bochum, Germany","Tajkhorshid, E; Rudack, T (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, NIH Ctr Macromol Modeling & Bioinformat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Tajkhorshid, E (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Dept Biochem, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Rudack, T (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Biophys, Bochum, Germany.",emad@life.illinois.edu; till.rudack@rub.de,,"Scheurer, Maximilian/0000-0003-0592-3464","state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC (bwForCluster MLSWISO); German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [INST 35/1134-1 FUGG]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41-GM104601]; DoE Office of Science User FacilityUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1616590]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601, P41GM104601] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1616590] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1616590] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The authors also acknowledge support by the state of Baden-Wurttemberg through bwHPC (bwForCluster MLS&WISO) and the German Research Foundation through grant INST 35/1134-1 FUGG, which enabled testing trajectories for several MD simulation systems.

While the molecular pathways to tertiary structure are still being worked out, with the axiom that similar sequences adopt similar structures, computational methods are being developed continually in parallel, utilizing the Protein Data Bank structural repository and homologue detection strategies to predict structures of sequences of interest. The success of this approach is limited by the ability to unravel the hidden similarities among amino acid sequences. We consider here the 20 amino acids as a complete set of chemical templates in the physicochemical space of proteins and propose a new structural and chemical classification of amino acids. An integration of this perspective into the conventional evolutionary methods of similarity detection leads to an unprecedented increase in the accuracy in homologue detection, resulting in improved protein structure prediction. The performance is validated on a large data set of 11716 unique proteins, and the results are benchmarked against conventional methods.

Besides obtaining the unfolding/folding rates, Markov state models allow gaining detailed insights into the folding dynamics and pathways through identifying folding intermediates and misfolded structures. For two specific peptides, we demonstrate that the end-to-end distance is an insufficient reaction coordinate. This problem is alleviated through constructing models with multiple collective variables, for which we employ the time-lagged independent component analysis requiring only minimal prior knowledge.

The coarse graining of MSMs into an interpretable number of macrostates is a crucial step for connecting theoretical results with experimental observables. Here we present the minimum variance clustering approach (MVCA) for the coarse-graining of MSMs into macrostate models. The method utilizes agglomerative clustering with Ward's minimum variance objective function, and the similarity of the microstate dynamics is determined using the Jensen Shannon divergence between the corresponding rows in the MSM transition probability matrix. We first show that MVCA produces intuitive results for a simple tripeptide system and is robust toward long-duration statistical artifacts. MVCA is then applied to two protein folding simulations of the same protein in different force fields to demonstrate that a different number of macrostates is appropriate for each model, revealing a misfolded state present in only one of the simulations. Finally, we show that the same method can be used to analyze a data set containing many MSMs from simulations in different force fields by aggregating them into groups and quantifying their dynamical similarity in the context of force field parameter choices. The minimum variance clustering approach with the Jensen Shannon divergence provides a powerful tool to group dynamics by similarity, both among model states and among dynamical models themselves.","[Husic, Brooke E.; McKiernan, Keri A.; Wayment-Steele, Hannah K.; Sultan, Mohammad M.; Pande, Vijay S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Pande, VS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Chem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",pande@stanford.edu,,"Husic, Brooke/0000-0002-8020-3750",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH R01-GM62868]; NSF Graduate Research Fellowhip Program,We acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH R01-GM62868).

The dynamical ordering mechanism of these biomolecules has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The main theoretical approaches include quantum mechanical (QM) calculation, all-atom (AA) modeling, and coarse-grained (CG) modeling. The selected approach depends on the size of the target system (which differs among electrons, atoms, molecules, and molecular assemblies). These hierarchal approaches can be combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and/or integral equation theories for liquids, which cover all size hierarchies. Scope of review: We review the framework of quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, AA MD simulations, CG modeling, and integral equation theories. Applications of these methods to the dynamical ordering of biomolecular systems are also exemplified. Major conclusions: The QM/MM calculation enables the study of chemical reactions. The AA MD simulation, which omits the QM calculation, can follow longer time-scale phenomena. By reducing the number of degrees of freedom and the computational cost, CG modeling can follow much longer time -scale phenomena than AA modeling. Integral equation theories for liquids elucidate the liquid structure, for example, whether the liquid follows a radial distribution function. General significance: These theoretical approaches can analyze the dynamic behaviors of biomolecular systems. They also provide useful tools for exploring the dynamic ordering systems of biomolecules, such as self-assembly.

In order to be used in concert with particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations, the model is purely based on interacting and reacting particles, each representing a coarse patch of a lipid monolayer. Particle interactions include nearest-neighbor bond-stretching and angle-bending and are parameterized so as to reproduce the local membrane mechanics given by the Helfrich energy density over a range of relevant curvatures. In-plane fluidity is implemented with Monte Carlo bond-flipping moves. The physical accuracy of the model is verified by five tests: (i) Power spectrum analysis of equilibrium thermal undulations is used to verify that the particle-based representation correctly captures the dynamics predicted by the continuum model of fluid membranes. (ii) It is verified that the input bending stiffness, against which the potential parameters are optimized, is accurately recovered. (iii) Isothermal area compressibility modulus of the membrane is calculated and is shown to be tunable to reproduce available values for different lipid bilayers, independent of the bending rigidity. (iv) Simulation of two-dimensional shear flow under a gravity force is employed to measure the effective in-plane viscosity of the membrane model and show the possibility of modeling membranes with specified viscosities. (v) Interaction of the bilayer membrane with a spherical nanoparticle is modeled as a test case for large membrane deformations and budding involved in cellular processes such as endocytosis. The results are shown to coincide well with the predicted behavior of continuum models, and the membrane model successfully mimics the expected budding behavior. We expect our model to be of high practical usability for ultra coarse-grained molecular dynamics or particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations of biological systems.

Traditionally, reaction coordinates, i.e., some functions of protein atom positions and velocities have been used to interpret the complex dynamics of proteins obtained from experimental and computational approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations. However, it is nontrivial to identify the reaction coordinates a priori even for small proteins. Here, we evaluate the power of evolutionary couplings (ECs) to capture protein dynamics by exploring their use as reaction coordinates, which can efficiently guide the sampling of a conformational free energy landscape. We have analyzed 10 diverse proteins and shown that a few ECs are sufficient to characterize complex conformational dynamics of proteins involved in folding and conformational change processes. With the rapid strides in sequencing technology, we expect that ECs could help identify reaction coordinates a priori and enhance the sampling of the slow dynamical process associated with protein folding and conformational change.","[Feng, Jiangyan; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar.shulda@shuklagroup.org,,"Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381; Feng, Jiangyan/0000-0003-0292-6758","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research via the new innovator award program","The authors thank the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the state of Illinois, for providing computing time for this study.

Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension- reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.","[Mardt, Andreas; Pasquali, Luca; Wu, Hao; Noe, Frank] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Noe, F (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",frank.noe@fu-berlin.de,"Noe, Frank/Y-2766-2019","Noe, Frank/0000-0003-4169-9324","Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Transregio 186/A12, SFB 1114/A4, 825/4-1, 2518]; European Research CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ERC StG 307494]","We are grateful to Cecilia Clementi, Robert T.

In this paper, we propose a multi-step time series generator using a deep neural network based on Wasserstein generative adversarial nets. Instead of sparse real data, our model evolves a latent variable z that is densely distributed in a low-dimensional space. This novel framework successfully mitigates the exposure bias. Moreover, our model can evolve part of the system (Feature extraction) with any time step (Step skip), which accelerates the efficient generation of MD data. The applicability of this model is evaluated through three different systems: harmonic oscillator, bulk water, and polymer melts. The experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate time series of the MD data with sufficient accuracy to calculate the physical and important dynamical statistics.","[Endo, Katsuhiro; Tomobe, Katsufumi; Yasuoka, Kenji] Keio Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan","Endo, K (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as Research and Development of Next-Generation FiledMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); MEXTMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","This work is supported in part by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as Research and Development of Next-Generation Filed.

The molecular determinants of this reduction are not very well understood yet, and their knowledge may help improving nanoparticle design. Here we address, using molecular dynamics simulations, the interactions of human serum albumin, the most abundant serum protein, with two promising hydrophilic polymers used for the coating of therapeutic nanoparticles, poly(ethyleneglycol) and poly-sarcosine. By simulating the protein immersed in a polymer-water mixture, we show that the two polymers have a very similar affinity for the protein surface, both in terms of the amount of polymer adsorbed and also in terms of the type of amino acids mainly involved in the interactions. We further analyze the kinetics of adsorption and how it affects the polymer conformations. Minor differences between the polymers are observed in the thickness of the adsorption layer, that are related to the different degree of flexibility of the two molecules. In comparison poly-alanine, an isomer of poly-sarcosine known to self-aggregate and induce protein aggregation, shows a significantly larger affinity for the protein surface than PEG and PSar, which we show to be related not to a different patterns of interactions with the protein surface, but to the different way the polymer interacts with water.

They are also used on their own right to discover the workings of the protein as a molecular machine, potential sites of interest for protein functioning, allosteric regions in proteins, and communication pathways between different sites on a protein. With the development of reliable force fields that describe interactions in biomolecules, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become the prime tool for this purpose. While it is now straight-forward to carry out MD simulations up to microseconds with current computers readily available to researchers, many processes of biological interest occur on several of orders of magnitudes slower timescales. Thus, the latter problems are attackable through MD by a handful of researchers that have access to the most powerful computers. Alternatively, physics-based methods to interrogate the protein energy landscape are in continuous development to circumvent this problem. In addition to opening the routes for advancement to a large number of researchers that have access to modest computational resources, they have the advantage of providing an understanding of the mechanisms that govern protein dynamics. Here we discuss network-based approaches geared toward understanding protein dynamics. These include (i) construction of residue networks which view proteins as networks of nodes connected through local interactions and (ii) construction of proteins as elastic networks whose modes of motion may be manipulated to achieve allowed conformational changes. Limitations of the methods as well as opportunities for future exploitation are described.","[Atilgan, Canan] Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey","Atilgan, C (corresponding author), Sabanci Univ, Fac Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",canan@sabanciuniv.edu,"Atilgan, Canan/C-7646-2009","Atilgan, Canan/0000-0003-0557-6044",,,,101,3,3,2,6,ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, SUITE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",1876-1623,,978-0-12-813916-5,ADV PROTEIN CHEM STR,Adv.

However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.","[Dignon, Gregory L.; Mittal, Jeetain] Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Zheng, Wenwei; Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kim, Young C.] Naval Res Lab, Ctr Mat Phys & Technol, Washington, DC 20375 USA; [Zheng, Wenwei] Arizona State Univ, Coll Integrat Sci & Arts, Mesa, AZ USA","Mittal, J (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",jeetain@lehigh.edu,"Zheng, Wenwei/M-5031-2015","Zheng, Wenwei/0000-0002-9603-009X; Mittal, Jeetain/0000-0002-9725-6402","US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0013979]; National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a DOE Office of Science User FacilityUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [TG-MCB120014]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research is supported by US Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences (BES) under Award DE-SC0013979.

Amino acid-based drugs are a group of biologic-based therapeutics that can effectively combat the diseases caused by drug resistance or molecular deficiency. Computational techniques play a key role to design and develop the amino acid-based therapeutics such as proteins, peptides and peptidomimetics. In this study, it was attempted to discuss the various elements for computational design of amino acid-based therapeutics. Protein design seeks to identify the properties of amino acid sequences that fold to predetermined structures with desirable structural and functional characteristics. Peptide drugs occupy a middle space between proteins and small molecules and it is hoped that they can target undruggable intracellular protein-protein interactions. Peptidomimetics, the compounds that mimic the biologic characteristics of peptides, present refined pharmacokinetic properties compared to the original peptides. Here, the elaborated techniques that are developed to characterize the amino acid sequences consistent with a specific structure and allow protein design are discussed. Moreover, the key principles and recent advances in currently introduced computational techniques for rational peptide design are spotlighted.

To maximize sampling efficiency, some adjustable parameters must be optimized. Although it is agreed that shorter intervals between the replica-exchange attempts enhance traversals in the temperature space, details regarding the artifacts caused by these short intervals are controversial. In this study, we revisit this problem by performing REMD simulations on an alanine octapeptide in an implicit solvent. Fifty different sets of conditions, which are a combination of five replica-exchange periods, five different numbers of replicas, and two thermostat coupling time constants, were investigated. As a result, although short replica-exchange intervals enhanced the traversals in the temperature space, they led to artifacts in the ensemble average of the temperature, potential energy, and helix content. With extremely short replica-exchange intervals, i.e., attempted at every time step, the ensemble average of the temperature deviated from the thermostat temperature by ca. 7 K. Differences in the ensembles were observed even for larger replica-exchange intervals (between 100 and 1,000 steps). In addition, the shorter thermostat coupling time constant reduced the artifacts found when short replica-exchange intervals were used, implying that these artifacts are caused by insufficient thermal relaxation between the replica-exchange events. Our results will be useful to reduce the artifacts found in REMD simulations by adjusting some key parameters.","[Iwai, Ryosuke] Ritsumeikan Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Kasahara, Kota; Takahashi, Takuya] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Noji Higashi 1-1-1, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan","Kasahara, K (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Noji Higashi 1-1-1, Kusatsu, Shiga 5258577, Japan.",ktkshr@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,,,,42,2,2,1,3,BIOPHYSICAL SOC JAPAN,SUITA,"GRADUATE SCH FRONTIER BIOSCIENCES, OSAKA UNIV, 1-3 YAMADAOKA, SUITA, 565-0871, JAPAN",2189-4779,,,BIOPHYS PHYSICOBIOL,Biophys.

We address especially the following questions: How to choose a computational approach suited to a particular problem? What are the strengths and limitations of alternative approaches? What is the current accuracy of thermodynamic and kinetic predictions? What are today's open challenges and promising development directions?

Metal-binding proteins (metalloproteins) are usually complicated to model, largely due to the presence of the metal cofactor. Thus, the study of metal-coupled folding is still challenging. In this work, we addressed the folding process of Pyrococcus furiosus rubredoxin (PfRd), a 53-residue protein binding a single iron ion, using different MD methods. Starting from an extended conformation of the polypeptide chain where we preserved the coordination of the metal ion, a classical MD simulation and an extensive accelerated MD run were performed to reconstruct the folding process of the metal-bound protein. For comparison, we simulated also the dynamics of folded PfRd devoid of the metal cofactor (apo-form), starting from the folded structure. For these MD trajectories, we computed various structural and biochemical properties. In addition, we took advantage of available experimental data to quantify the degree to which our simulations sampled conformations close to the native folded state. We observed that the compaction of the hydrophobic core is the main feature driving the folding of the structure. However, we could not reach a fully folded conformation within our trajectories, because of the incomplete removal of the solvent from the core. Altogether, the various MD simulations, including that of the folded apo-form of the protein, suggest that an improvement in the accuracy of the protein force-field is still needed.","[Sala, Davide; Rosato, Antonio] Univ Florence, Magnet Resonance Ctr CERM, Via Luigi Sacconi 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Giachetti, Andrea] Interuniv Consortium Magnet Resonance Metallo Pro, Via Luigi Sacconi 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Rosato, Antonio] Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Via Lastruccia 3, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy","Rosato, A (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Magnet Resonance Ctr CERM, Via Luigi Sacconi 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.; Rosato, A (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Chem, Via Lastruccia 3, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.",rosato@cerm.unifi.it,"Rosato, Antonio/D-8548-2011; Sala, Davide/N-4804-2019; Rosato, Antonio/M-3250-2019","Rosato, Antonio/0000-0001-6172-0368; Sala, Davide/0000-0002-3900-0011; Rosato, Antonio/0000-0001-6172-0368",EUROPEAN COMMISSIONEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [675858]; CIRMMP,"This work was supported by the EUROPEAN COMMISSION (project number 675858, West-Life) and by CIRMMP.",,52,1,1,1,2,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2377-9098,,,AIMS BIOPHYS,AIMS Biophys.,,2018,5,1,,,,,77,96,,10.3934/biophy.2018.1.77,,,20,Biophysics,Biophysics,GP3DP,WOS:000440721700005,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

If these CVs are coincident with the slow collective modes governing the long-time dynamical evolution, then they also furnish good coordinates in which to perform enhanced sampling to surmount high free energy barriers and efficiently explore and recover the landscape. Non-linear manifold learning techniques provide a means to systematically extract such CVs from molecular simulation trajectories by identifying and extracting low-dimensional manifolds lying latent within the high-dimensional coordinate space. We survey recent advances in data-driven CV discovery and enhanced sampling using non-linear manifold learning, describe the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of these techniques, and present illustrative examples to molecular folding and colloidal self-assembly.

These structural transitions are induced as slow dynamics upon collective motions including biologically relevant large-amplitude fluctuations of proteins. Although molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool for reproducing the structural transitions of proteins, it might still be difficult to reach time scales of the biological functions, since the accessible time scale of conventional MD (CMD) simulation is far from them. To tackle the timescale issue of the CMD simulation, we developed several efficient conformational sampling methods based on a strategy of cascade-type MD.

Theories have been developed that provide us with an unprecedented understanding of protein folding mechanisms. However, computational simulation of protein folding is still difficult, and prediction of protein tertiary structure from amino acid sequence is an unsolved problem. Progress toward a satisfying solution has been slow due to challenges in sampling the vast conformational space and deriving sufficiently accurate energy functions. Nevertheless, several techniques and algorithms have been adopted to overcome these challenges, and the last two decades have seen exciting advances in enhanced sampling algorithms, computational power and tertiary structure prediction methodologies. This review aims at summarizing these computational techniques, specifically conformational sampling algorithms and energy approximations that have been frequently used to study protein- folding mechanisms or to de novo predict protein tertiary structures. We hope that this review can serve as an overview on how the protein- folding problem can be studied computationally and, in cases where experimental approaches are prohibitive, help the researcher choose the most relevant computational approach for the problem at hand.

Two main approaches to the problem of folding were selected for this review: geometrical and biophysical. The geometrical approach allows the formulation of topological restrictions on folding, that are usually not taken into account in the construction of physical models. In particular, the topological constraints do not allow the known funnel-like energy landscape modeling, although most common methods of resolving the paradox are based on this method. The very paradox is based on the fact that complex molecules must reach their native conformations (complexes that result from reactions) in an exponentially long time, which clearly contradicts the observed experimental data. In this respect we considered the complexity of the reactions between ligands and proteins. On this general basis, the folding-reaction paradox was reformulated and generalized. We conclude that prospects for solving the paradox should be associated with incorporating a topology aspect in biophysical models of protein folding, through the construction of hybrid models. However, such models should explicitly include long-range force fields and local cell biological conditions, such as structured water complexes and photon/phonon/soliton waves, ordered in discrete frequency bands. In this framework, collective and coherent oscillations in, and between, macromolecules are instrumental in inducing intra- and intercellular resonance, serving as an integral guiding network of life communication: the electrome aspect of the cell. Yet, to identify the actual mechanisms underlying the bonds between molecules (atoms), it will be necessary to perform dedicated experiments to more definitely solve the particular time paradox.

There is strong evidence suggesting that structural changes occurring in large biomolecular systems at long time scale dynamics may be captured by models coarser than atomistic, although a suitable or optimal coarse-graining is a priori unknown. Here we propose a systematic approach to learning a coarse representation of a macromolecule from microscopic simulation data. In particular, the definition of effective coarse variables is achieved by partitioning the degrees of freedom both in the structural (physical) space and in the conformational space. The identification of groups of microscopic particles forming dynamical coherent states in different metastable states leads to a multiscale description of the system, in space and time. The application of this approach to the folding dynamics of two proteins provides a revised view of the classical idea of prestructured regions (foldons) that combine during a protein-folding process and suggests a hierarchical characterization of the assembly process of folded structures.","[Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Boninsegna, Lorenzo; Clementi, Cecilia] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Banisch, Ralf; Clementi, Cecilia] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Clementi, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",cecilia@rice.edu,,"Clementi, Cecilia/0000-0001-9221-2358","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, PHY-1427654]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [C-1570]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC1114]; Big Data Private-Cloud Research Cyberinfrastructure MRI-award (NSF) [CNS-1338099]; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Freie Universitat, Berlin; Direct For Mathematical & Physical ScienNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1265929] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (CHE-1265929, CHE-1738990, and PHY-1427654), the Welch Foundation (C-1570), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through CRC1114 (Project B03).

This is a textbook question. Parsing the experimental free energies of folding/unfolding into diverse enthalpic and entropic components of solute and solvent favoring or disfavoring folding is not an easy task. In this study, we present a computational protocol for estimating the free energy contributors to protein folding semi-quantitatively using ensembles of unfolded and native states generated via molecular dynamics simulations. We tested the methodology on 35 proteins with diverse structural motifs and sizes and found that the calculated free energies correlate well with experiment (correlation coefficient approximate to 0.85), enabling us to develop a consensus view of the energetics of folding. As a more sensitive test of the methodology, we also investigated the free energies of folding of an additional 33 single point mutants and obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.8. A notable observation is that the folding free energy components appear to carry signatures of the fold (SCOP classification) of the protein.

In the present study, temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD is proposed as a further extension of temperature-aided PaCS-MD in which the temperatures are shuffled among different replicas at the beginning of each cycle of conformational resampling. To evaluate their conformational sampling efficiencies, the original, temperature-aided, and temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD were applied to a protein-folding process of Trp-cage, and their minimum computational costs to identify the native state were addressed. Through the evaluation, it was confirmed that temperature-shuffled PaCS-MD remarkably accelerated the protein-folding process of Trp-cage compared with the other methods.

The challenge posed by the competition of nonnative stabilization against native-centric forces is conceptualized as frustration. Experiment indicates that frustration is often minimal in evolved biological systems although nonnative possibilities are intuitively abundant. Much of the physical basis of minimal frustration in protein folding thus remains to be elucidated. Here we make progress by studying the colicin immunity protein Im9. To assess the energetic favorability of nonnative versus native interactions, we compute free energies of association of various combinations of the four helices in Im9 (referred to as H1, H2, H3, and H4) by extensive explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations (total simulated time > 300 mu s), focusing primarily on the pairs with the largest native contact surfaces, H1-H2 and H1-H4. Frustration is detected in H1-H2 packing in that a nonnative packing orientation is significantly stabilized relative to native, whereas such a prominent nonnative effect is not observed for H1-H4 packing. However, in contrast to the favored nonnative H1-H2 packing in isolation, the native H1-H2 packing orientation is stabilized by H3 and loop residues surrounding H4. Taken together, these results showcase the contextual nature of molecular recognition, and suggest further that nonnative effects in H1-H2 packing may be largely avoided by the experimentally inferred Im9 folding transition state with native packing most developed at the H1-H4 rather than the H1-H2 interface.","[Huynh, Loan; Pomes, Regis; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Neale, Chris] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, Troy, NY USA; [Pomes, Regis] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada","Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada.",pomes@sickkids.ca; chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,,"CHAN, Hue Sun/0000-0002-1381-923X",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [418679]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating GrantsCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-84281]; CIHR Training Program Protein Folding and Interaction Dynamics: Principles and Diseases at the University of TorontoCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR),"This work was supported by Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant 418679 to RP, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Operating Grants MOP-84281 to HSC, and a postdoctoral fellowship for LH from the CIHR Training Program Protein Folding and Interaction Dynamics: Principles and Diseases at the University of Toronto.

However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directiy onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.","[Cournia, Zoe] Acad Athens, Biomed Res Fdn, 4 Soranou Ephessiou, Athens 11527, Greece; [Allen, Bryce; Sherman, Woody] Silicon Therapeut, 300 A St, Boston, MA 02210 USA","Cournia, Z (corresponding author), Acad Athens, Biomed Res Fdn, 4 Soranou Ephessiou, Athens 11527, Greece.; Sherman, W (corresponding author), Silicon Therapeut, 300 A St, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",zcournia@bioacademy.gr; woody@silicontx.com,"Sherman, Woody/AAF-6952-2020; Allen, Bryce/AAI-1512-2019","Allen, Bryce/0000-0002-0804-8127; Sherman, Woody/0000-0001-9079-1376; Cournia, Zoe/0000-0001-9287-364X",European Commission under H2020 Research Infrastructures [675121],"The authors thank Davide Branduardi and Thomas Steinbrecher for helpful discussions.

Two folding pathways were found to be characteristic of this protein: pathway I, in which the hydrophobic collapse precedes the formation of alpha-helix, and pathway II, in which the events occur in the reverse order. At the same time, the relative contribution of these pathways at different temperatures as well as the nature of transition from one pathway to the other remain unclear. To gain insight into this issue, we employ a recently proposed hydrodynamic description of protein folding, in which the process of folding is considered as a motion of a folding fluid (Chekmarev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100(1), 018107 2008). Using molecular dynamics simulations, we determine the field of probability fluxes of transitions in a space of collective variables and divide it into stream tubes. Each tube contains a definite fraction of the total folding flow and can be associated with a certain pathway. Specifically, three temperatures were considered, T = 285K, T = 315K, and T = 325K. We have found that as the temperature increases, the contribution of pathway I, which is approximately 90% of the total folding flow at T = 285K, decreases to approximately 10% at T = 325K, i.e., pathway II becomes dominant. At T = 315K, both pathways contribute approximately equally. All these temperatures are found below the calculated melting point, which suggests that the Trp-cage folding mechanism is determined by kinetic factors rather than thermodynamics.","[Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.; Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",vladimir.andryushchenko@gmail.com; chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru,,,Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00325],This work was performed under a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (No. 14-14-00325).

Using reactive molecular dynamics and an accelerated simulation framework, the replica exchange molecular dynamics method, we simulate the full transformation of cellulose into kerogen and its associated fluid phase under prevailing geological conditions. We observe in sequence the fragmentation of the cellulose crystal and production of water, the development of an unsaturated aliphatic macromolecular phase and its aromatization. The composition of the solid residue along the maturation pathway strictly follows what is observed for natural type III kerogen and for artificially matured samples under confined conditions. After expulsion of the fluid phase, the obtained microporous kerogen possesses the structure, texture, density, porosity and stiffness observed for mature type III kerogen and a microporous carbon obtained by saccharose pyrolysis at low temperature. As expected for this variety of precursor, the main resulting hydrocarbon is methane. The present work thus demonstrates that molecular simulations can now be used to assess, almost quantitatively, such complex chemical processes as petrogenesis in fossil reservoirs and, more generally, the possible conversion of any natural product into bio-sourced materials and/or fuel.","[Atmani, Lea; Pellenq, Roland J. -M.; Van Damme, Henri; Raza, Zamaan; Obliger, Amael; Ulm, Franz J.; Leyssale, Jean-Marc] MIT, CNRS Joint Lab MultiScale Mat Sci Energy & Enviro, MIT Energy Initiat, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Atmani, Lea; Bichara, Christophe; Pellenq, Roland J. -M.] Ctr Interdisciplinaire Nanosci Marseille, CNRS, Campus Luminy,Case 913, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Pellenq, Roland J. -M.; Ulm, Franz J.] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [van Duin, Adri C.

However, due to the lack of multiscale models and the limitation of computational capability, such reactors are traditionally treated as continua through straightforward averaging in engineering simulations or as completely discrete systems in theoretical studies. The continuum approach is advantageous in terms of the scale and speed of computation but does not always give good predictions, which is, in many cases, the strength of the discrete approach. On the other hand, however, the discrete approach is too computationally expensive for engineering applications. Developments in computing science and technologies and encouraging progress in multiscale modeling have enabled discrete simulations to be extended to engineering systems and represent a promising approach to virtual process engineering (VPE, or virtual reality in process engineering). In this review, we analyze this emerging trend and emphasize that multiscale discrete simulations (MSDS), that is, considering multiscale structures in discrete simulation through rational coarse-graining and coupling between discrete and continuum methods with the effect of mesoscale structures accounted in both cases, is an effective way forward, which can be complementary to the continuum approach that is being improved by multiscale modeling also. For this purpose, our review is not meant to be a complete summary to the literature on discrete simulation, but rather a demonstration of its feasibility for engineering applications. We therefore discuss the enabling methods and technologies for MSDS, taking granular and particle-fluid flows as typical examples in chemical engineering. We cover the spectrum of modeling, numerical methods, algorithms, software implementation and even hardware-software codesign. The structural consistency among these aspects is shown to be the pivot for the success of MSDS. We conclude that with these developments, MSDS could soon become, among others, a mainstream simulation approach in chemical engineering which enables VPE.","[Ge, Wei; Wang, Limin; Xu, Ji; Chen, Feiguo; Zhou, Guangzheng; Lu, Liqiang; Chang, Qi; Li, Jinghai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst MPCS, POB 353, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wei; Chang, Qi] Tianjin Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Engn Tianjin, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Chang, Qi] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Ge, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst MPCS, POB 353, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.; Ge, W (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Ge, W (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Engn Tianjin, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",wge@ipe.ac.cn,,"Chen, Feiguo/0000-0002-2455-7589; Lu, Liqiang/0000-0002-5101-1688","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21225628, 21206167, 91434113, 91434201, 21106155, 2110645]; CASChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA07080000, QYZDB-SSW-SYS029]; CAS (CAS Interdisciplinary Innovation Team); National Program on Key Basic Research ProjectNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB251402]","The authors would like to thank all members of the EMMS group for their contributions to the studies and developments reviewed in this article and for their collaboration and support in its preparation, especially Shiwen Liu, Xiaowen Liu, and Mengjie Du, for their help in the literature survey and drawing; Yanfeng Shi for editing; and Guoxian Gao for the visualization of some computational results.

Implicit solvent models are sought as routes to increase the capability of simulation, with trade-offs between computational speed and accuracy. Here, we systematically investigate the folding of a variety of alpha-helix bundle proteins ranging in size from 46 to 102 amino acids using a state-of-the-art force field and an implicit solvent model. The accurate all-atom simulated folding is enabled for six proteins, including for the first time a successful folding of protein with >100 amino acids in implicit solvent. The detailed free-energy landscape analysis sheds light on a set of general principles underlying the folding of alpha-helix bundle proteins, suggesting a hybrid framework/nucleation-condensation mechanism favorably adopted in implicit solvent condition. The similarities and discrepancies of the folding pathways measured among the present implicit solvent simulations and previously reported experiments and explicit solvent simulations are deeply analyzed, providing quantitative assessment for the availability and limitation of implicit solvent simulation in exploring the folding transition of large-size proteins.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.; Shao, Q (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095; Zhu, Weiliang/0000-0001-6699-5299",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund [U1501501],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21373258), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501.

Chem. Phys., 2011, 135, 194110). To critically examine if T-RE with independence sampling (T-REis) improves conformational sampling, we performed T-RE and T-REis simulations of ordered and disordered proteins using coarse-grained and atomistic models. The results demonstrate that T-REis effectively increase the replica mobility in temperatures space with minimal computational overhead, especially for folded proteins. However, enhanced mixing does not translate well into improved conformational sampling. The convergences of thermodynamic properties interested are similar, with slight improvements for T-REis of ordered systems. The study re-affirms the efficiency of T-RE does not appear to be limited by temperature diffusion, but by the inherent rates of spontaneous large-scale conformational re-arrangements. Due to its simplicity and efficacy of enhanced mixing, T-REis is expected to be more effective when incorporated with various Hamiltonian-RE protocols.

This process requires the DNA-binding protein to quickly exchange between a search competent and a target recognition mode, but little is known as to how these two binding modes are encoded in the conformational properties of the protein. Here, we investigate this issue on the engrailed homeodomain (EngHD), a DNA-binding domain that folds ultrafast and exhibits a complex conformational behavior consistent with the downhill folding scenario. We explore the interplay between folding and DNA recognition using a coarse-grained computational model that allows us to manipulate the folding properties of the protein and monitor its non-specific and specific binding to DNA. We find that conformational disorder increases the search efficiency of EngHD by promoting a fast gliding search mode in addition to sliding. When gliding, EngHD remains loosely bound to DNA moving linearly along its length. A partially disordered EngHD also binds more dynamically to the target site, reducing the half-life of the specific complex via a spring-loaded mechanism. These findings apply to all conditions leading to partial disorder. However, we also find that at physiologically relevant temperatures EngHD is well folded and can only obtain the conformational flexibility required to accelerate 1D diffusion when it folds/ unfolds within the downhill scenario (crossing a marginal free energy barrier). In addition, the conformational flexibility of native downhill EngHD enables its fast reconfiguration to lock into the specific binding site upon arrival, thereby affording finer control of the on-and off-rates of the specific complex. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into how DNA-binding domains optimize specific DNA recognition through the control of their conformational dynamics and folding mechanism.","[Chu, Xiakun; Munoz, Victor] IMDEA Nanosci, Faraday 9,Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Munoz, Victor] CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3,Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Munoz, Victor] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, Dept Bioengn, Merced, CA 95343 USA","Munoz, V (corresponding author), IMDEA Nanosci, Faraday 9,Campus Cantoblanco, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3,Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, Dept Bioengn, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",vmunoz@cnb.csic.es,"Chu, Xiakun/AAE-9442-2019","Chu, Xiakun/0000-0003-3166-7070",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-ADG-323059]; Keck foundationW.M.

Elastin and elastin-like peptides are hydrophobic, disordered, and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation upon self-assembly. Despite extensive study, the structure of elastin remains controversial. We use molecular dynamics simulations on a massive scale to elucidate the structural ensemble of aggregated elastin-like peptides. Consistent with the entropic nature of elastic recoil, the aggregated state is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect. However, self-assembly does not entail formation of a hydrophobic core. The polypeptide backbone forms transient, sparse hydrogen-bonded turns and remains significantly hydrated even as self-assembly triples the extent of non-polar side chain contacts. Individual chains in the assembly approach a maximally-disordered, melt-like state which may be called the liquid state of proteins. These findings resolve long-standing controversies regarding elastin structure and function and afford insight into the phase separation of disordered proteins.","[Rauscher, Sarah; Pomes, Regis] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rauscher, Sarah; Pomes, Regis] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rauscher, Sarah] Univ Toronto, Dept Chem & Phys Sci, Mississauga, ON, Canada","Pomes, R (corresponding author), Hosp Sick Children, Mol Med, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Pomes, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada.",pomes@sickkids.ca,,"Rauscher, Sarah/0000-0001-9860-3237",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP84496]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR; Hospital for Sick Children,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research MOP84496 Regis Pomes; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Sarah Rauscher; Hospital for Sick Children Sarah Rauscher; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",,97,36,36,4,30,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,Nov-09,2017,6,,,,,,,,e26526,10.7554/eLife.26526,,,21,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,FX2DC,WOS:000425867800001,29120326,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

It is perfectly reversible, which is essential for a proper thermodynamic characterization of a protein equilibrium. In contrast to other perturbation methods such as heat or chemical denaturant that destabilize protein structures uniformly, pressure exerts local effects on regions or domains of a protein containing internal cavities. When combined with NMR spectroscopy, hydrostatic pressure offers the possibility to monitor at a residue level the structural transitions occurring upon unfolding and to determine the kinetic properties of the process. High-pressure NMR experiments can now be routinely performed, owing to the recent development of commercially available high-pressure sample cells. This review summarizes recent advances and some future directions of high-pressure NMR techniques for the characterization at atomic resolution of the energy landscape of protein folding.

However, the lack of a complete accurate crystal structure of HIV-1 IN greatly blocks the discovery of novel inhibitors. In this work, an effective HIV-1 IN inhibitor screening platform, namely PFV IN, was filtered from all species of INs. Next, the 40.8% similarity with HIV-1 IN, as well as the high efficiency of virtual screening and the good agreement between calculated binding free energies and experimental ones all proved PFV IN is a promising screening platform for HIV-1 IN inhibitors. Then, the molecular recognition mechanism of PFV IN by its substrate viral DNA and six naphthyridine derivatives (NRDs) inhibitors was investigated through molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and water-mediated interactions analyses. The functional partition of NRDs IN inhibitors could be divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic ones, and the Mg2+ ions, water molecules and conserved DDE motif residues all interacted with the hydrophilic partition, while the bases in viral DNA and residues like Tyr212, Pro214 interacted with the hydrophobic one. Finally, the free energy landscape (FEL) and cluster analyses were performed to explore the molecular motion of PFV IN-DNA system. It is found that the association with NRDs inhibitors would obviously decrease the motion amplitude of PFV IN-DNA, which may be one of the most potential mechanisms of IN inhibitors. This work will provide a theoretical basis for the inhibitor design based on the structure of HIV-1 IN. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To promote structural transitions from the reactant to the product, PaCS-MD repeats cycles of conformational resampling of (1) reasonable initial structures and (2) short-time MD simulations restarting the structures with renewed velocities. Appropriately setting a number of these initial structures is essential for efficient PaCS-MD. We propose a novel, optimal algorithm for specifying suitable initial structures, n(initial), to find structural transitions; this is referred to as dn-PaCS-MD. PaCS-MD typically has a fixed ninitial, while in dn-PaCS-MD it is dynamically reset according to a minimum root mean square deviation (RMSD), defined as an RMSD derivative. dn-PaCS-MD, with the dynamic n(initial) accelerates structural transitions to the product, compared to the original PaCS-MD with the fixed ninitial, as confirmed in C-initial protein-folding. This algorithm was also applied to Human-beta-defensin 2, whose X-ray and NMR structures differ in the N-terminal region. Finally, we compared forward and backward transition pathways from the former to the latter generated by our method, and estimated a free energy barrier between them, creating new possibilities to visualize the NMR and X-ray structures in solution.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientist [15J03797]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H06164, 26102525, 26107004, 26105012]; Initiative on Promotion of Supercomputing for Young or Women Researchers; Information Technology Center; University of Tokyo; TSUBAME Encouragement Program for Young/Female Users of Global Scientific Information and Computing Center; Tokyo Institute of Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K21719, 16H06164, 26105012, 15J03797] Funding Source: KAKEN","The present work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientist (No. 15J03797) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in- Aid for Young Scientists (A) (No. 16H06164) and by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Dynamic Ordering and Biofunction, Photosynergetics, and 3D Active-Site Science (Nos. 26102525, 26107004, and 26105012).

One can harness protein family sequence data to infer likely contacts between pairs of residues. In the current study, we combine this kind of inference from coevolutionary information with a coarse-grained protein force field ordinarily used with single sequence input, the Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model (AWSEM), to achieve improved structure prediction. The resulting Associative memory, Water mediated, Structure and Energy Model with Evolutionary Restraints (AWSEM-ER) yields a significant improvement in the quality of protein structure prediction over the single sequence prediction from AWSEM when a sufficiently large number of homologous sequences are available. Free energy landscape analysis shows that the addition of the evolutionary term shifts the free energy minimum to more native-like structures, which explains the improvement in the quality of structures when performing predictions using simulated annealing. Simulations using AWSEM without coevolutionary information have proved useful in elucidating not only protein folding behavior, but also mechanisms of protein function. The success of AWSEM-ER in de novo structure prediction suggests that the enhanced model opens the door to functional studies of proteins even when no experimentally solved structures are available.","[Sirovetz, Brian J.; Schafer, Nicholas P.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX USA; [Sirovetz, Brian J.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, Houston, TX USA; [Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, Houston, TX USA","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), 6100 Main St MS 654, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",pwolynes@rice.edu,,"Schafer, Nicholas/0000-0001-9789-2516","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM44557]; Rice University [C-0016]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1338099]; Rice University; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557, R01GM044557] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by Grant R01 GM44557 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

The HA-G (o) over bar model was implemented at two different pulling speeds for comparison. The most-common sequence of unfolding in the AA model agrees well with the most common unfolding sequence of the HA-G (o) over bar model, when the same normalized pulling rate was used. Clustering of partially-native structures as the protein unfolds shows that the AA and HA-G (o) over bar models both exhibit a dominant pathway for early unfolding, which eventually bifurcates repeatedly to multiple branches after the protein is about half-unfolded. The force-extension curve exhibits multiple force drops, which are concomitant with jumps in the local interaction potential energy between specific beta-strands in the protein. These sudden jumps in the potential energy coincide with the dissociation of specific pairs of beta-strands, and thus intermediate unfolding events. The most common sequence of beta-strand dissociation in the unfolding pathway of the AA model is beta-strands 5, 4, 8, 7, 1, 2, then finally beta-strands 3 and 6. The observation that beta-strand 5 is among the first to unfold here, but the last to unfold in simulations of loop-truncated SOD1, could imply the existence of an evolutionary compensation mechanism, which would stabilize beta-strands flanking long loops against their entropic penalty by strengthening intramolecular interactions.

In the realm of biomolecular modeling, large systems like proteins comprise very many noncovalent interactions (NCIs) that can contribute to the protein's stability and structure. This work presents two high-quality chemical databases of common fragment interactions in biomolecular systems as extracted from high-resolution Protein DataBank crystal structures: 3380 sidechain-sidechain interactions and 100 backbone-backbone interactions that inaugurate the BioFragment Database (BFDb). Absolute interaction energies are generated with a computationally tractable explicitly correlated coupled cluster with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)-F12] silver standard (0.05 kcal/mol average error) for NCI that demands only a fraction of the cost of the conventional gold standard, CCSD(T) at the complete basis set limit. By sampling extensively from biological environments, BFDb spans the natural diversity of protein NCI motifs and orientations. In addition to supplying a thorough assessment for lower scaling force-field (2), semi-empirical (3), density functional (244), and wavefunction (45) methods (comprising > 1M interaction energies), BFDb provides interactive tools for running and manipulating the resulting large datasets and offers a valuable resource for potential energy model development and validation.

Time scales and force field accuracy are key factors for the reliability of these simulations. With the advancement of computational platforms and simulation technologies, all-atom simulations of proteins in explicitly represented aqueous solutions can reach as long as milliseconds. However, there are indications of minor force field flaws in literature. In this work we present our observations on force field accuracy under uncommon conditions. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of BBL refolding in aqueous solutions of acidic pH and high salt concentrations (up to 6 M) with the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field for a microsecond time scale. The reliability of the simulations relies on the accuracy of the physical models of protein, water, and ions. Our simulations show the same trend as experiments: higher salt concentration facilities refolding. However, we have observed the presence of beta-sheet in the native helical region as well as alpha-helix and beta-sheet in the native loop region. Some of the nonnative secondary structures are even more stable than native helices. Aside from the secondary structure issue under the uncommon conditions, we have found that the rigidity of glycine dihedral angles in the loop region leads to low root-mean-square deviations but large topological differences from the native structure. Whether this is due to a force field deficiency or not needs further investigations. Recently developed ion parameters exhibit evident liquid features even in the 6 M LiC1 solution. However, cation anion interactions in TIP3P water still seem too strong, leading to high fractions of contact ion pairs. We do not find any specific ion-binding motif, thus we conclude that the effect of salt is a nonspecific electrostatic screening in our simulations. Our observations on the AMBER force field performance under acidic conditions and high salt concentrations show that simulations under extreme conditions can provide informative tests of physical models.","[Liu, Hanzhong; Tan, Qingzhe; Huo, Shuanghong] Clark Univ, Gustaf H Carlson Sch Chem & Biochem, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Han, Li] Clark Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA","Huo, SH (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Gustaf H Carlson Sch Chem & Biochem, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.; Han, L (corresponding author), Clark Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",lhan@darku.edu; shuo@clarku.edu,,"Huo, Shuanghong/0000-0002-2196-0858","National Resource for Biomedical Supercomputing and Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center [MCB110061P, PSCA12013P]; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [P41GM103712-S1, R01-GM088326]; Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM088326, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM088326, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM088326, P41GM103712, R01GM088326, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM088326, P41GM103712] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",We thank Dr. Da-wei Li for helpful discussions.

Herein, we discuss the stability of the folded and unfolded structures of proteins obtained from Anton's long simulations (Lindorff-Larsen, K; Piana, S.; Dror, R. O.; Shaw, D.E. Science, 2011, 334, 517-520). Specifically, the stabilities of CLN025, the WW domain variant GTT, the triple mutant of the redesigned protein G variant NuG2, and the de novo-designed three-helix bundle protein are investigated. The solvation free energy of the structures is calculated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the reference-modified density functional theory. The total energy is given by the sum of the conformational energy and the solvation free energy, and their balance results in the stabilization of protein structure, as demonstrated by the correspondence between structures with the lowest total energy of all proteins to their native structures. Overall, these findings indicate that the total energy function is appropriate for evaluating the stability of protein folding systems. Moreover, decomposing the energy terms reveals that proteins achieve their stabilities from the balance between the conformational energy and the solvation free energy. In particular, the solvation entropy is the main contributor to the process of folding from more extended structures to compact structures. The native structure is more stable than the compact structure owing to competition between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions.","[Maruyama, Yutaka] RIKEN Adv Inst Computat Sci, Codesign Team, FLAGSHIP Project 2020, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Mitsutake, Ayori] Keio Univ, Dept Phys, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan","Mitsutake, A (corresponding author), Keio Univ, Dept Phys, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",ayori@mail.rk.phys.keio.ac.jp,"Maruyama, Yutaka/C-7429-2016","Maruyama, Yutaka/0000-0003-4035-4885","PRESTO, JSTJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJPR13LB]; NIGMSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41-GM103311]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103311, P41GM103311, P41GM103311, P41GM103311, P41GM103311, P41GM103311] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by PRESTO, JST (JPMJPR13LB).

These paths are sampled with a probability given by the overdamped Langevin dynamics. We show that these paths can be exactly generated by a local stochastic partial differential equation. This equation cannot be solved in general but we present several approximations that are valid either in the low temperature regime or in the presence of barrier crossing. We show that this method warrants the generation of statistically independent transition paths. It is computationally very efficient. We illustrate the method first on two simple potentials, the two-dimensional Mueller potential and the Mexican hat potential, and then on the multi-dimensional problem of conformational transitions in proteins using the Mixed Elastic Network Model as a benchmark.

First, continuous trajectories corresponding to system replicas evolving at different temperatures are used to assign conformational states. Second, we analyze the entire REMD data to calculate the corresponding rates at each temperature directly from the number of transition counts. Finally, we compare the kinetics extracted directly, using the DTC method, with indirect estimations based on trajectory likelihood maximization using short-time propagators and on decay rates of state autocorrelation functions. For systems with relatively low-dimensional intrinsic conformational dynamics, the DTC method is simple to implement and leads to accurate temperature-dependent rates. We apply the DTC rate-extraction method to all-atom REMD simulations of dimerization of amyloid-forming NNQQ tetrapetides in explicit water. In an assessment of the REMD sampling efficiency with respect to standard MD, we find a gain of more than a factor of two at the lowest temperature.

Shooting trial trajectories from configurations along existing transition paths proved particularly efficient in the sampling of reactive trajectories. However, most shooting attempts tend not to result in transition paths, in particular in cases where the transition dynamics has diffusive character. To overcome the resulting efficiency problem, we developed an algorithm for shooting from the top. We first define a shooting range through which all paths have to pass and then shoot off trial trajectories only from within this range. For a well chosen shooting range, nearly every shot is successful, resulting in an accepted transition path. To deal with multiple mechanisms, weighted shooting ranges can be used. To cope with the problem of unsuitably placed shooting ranges, we developed an algorithm that iteratively improves the location of the shooting range. The transition path sampling procedure is illustrated for models of diffusive and Langevin dynamics. The method should be particularly useful in cases where the transition paths are long so that only relatively few shots are possible, yet reasonable order parameters are known.

However, the folding times of these proteins derived from the simulations were more than 4-10 times longer than their experimental values. This article reports autonomous folding of CLN025 and Trp-cage in isobaric isothermal molecular dynamics simulations with agreements within factors of 0.69-1.75 between simulated and experimental folding times at different temperatures. These results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously fold in silico as fast as in experiments, and suggest that the accuracy of folding simulations for fast-folding proteins begins to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments. This opens new prospects of developing computer algorithms that can predict both ensembles of conformations and their interconversion rates for a protein from its sequence for artificial intelligence on how and when a protein acts as a receiver, switch, and relay to facilitate various subcellular-to-tissue communications. Then the genetic information that encodes proteins can be better read in the context of intricate biological functions. (C) 2017 The Author.

Using the S-2 order parameter and a surrogate for the protein enthalpy in conjunction with metadynamics or variationally enhanced sampling, we are able to reversibly fold and unfold a small protein and draw its free energy at a fraction of the time that is needed in unbiased simulations. We also use S-2 in combination with the free energy flooding method to compute the unfolding rate of this peptide.

Recent developments in statistical methods for computation of direct evolutionary couplings between amino acids within and across polypeptide chains have allowed for inference of native residue contacts, informing accurate prediction of protein folds and multimeric structures. In this study, we assess the use of distances between evolutionarily coupled residues as natural choices for reaction coordinates which can be incorporated into Markov state model-based adaptive sampling schemes and potentially used to predict not only functional conformations but also pathways of conformational change, protein folding, and protein-protein association. We demonstrate the utility of evolutionary couplings in sampling and predicting activation pathways of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR), folding of the FiP35 WW domain, and dimerization of the E. coli molybdopterin synthase subunits. We find that the time required for beta(2)-AR activation and folding of the WW domain are greatly diminished using evolutionary couplings-guided adaptive sampling. Additionally, we were able to identify putative molybdopterin synthase association pathways and near-crystal structure complexes from protein-protein association simulations.","[Shamsi, Zahra; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Moffett, Alexander S.; Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Shukla, Diwakar] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Shukla, D (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",diwakar.shukla@shuklagroup.org,,"Moffett, Alexander/0000-0003-1631-2722; Shukla, Diwakar/0000-0003-4079-5381","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]","We thank DE Shaw Research for providing the beta<INF>2</INF>-AR, FiP35 WW domain, and lambda-repressor trajectories.

Here we predicted the short protein structures by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which only Newton's equations of motion were used and 3D structural information of known proteins was not required. To evaluate the ability of MD simulationto predict protein structures, we calculated seven short test protein (10-46 residues) in the denatured state and compared their predicted and experimental structures. The predicted structure for Trp-cage (20 residues) was close to the experimental structure by 200-ns MD simulation. For proteins shorter or longer than Trp-cage, root-mean square deviation values were larger than those for Trp-cage. However, secondary structures could be reproduced by MD simulations for proteins with 10-34 residues. Simulations by replica exchange MD were performed, but the results were similar to those from normal MD simulations. These results suggest that normal MD simulations can roughly predict short protein structures and 200-ns simulations are frequently sufficient for estimating the secondary structures of protein (approximately 20 residues). Structural prediction method using only fundamental physical laws are useful for investigating non-natural proteins, such as primitive proteins and artificial proteins for peptide-based drug delivery systems.","[Kato, Koichi; Nakayoshi, Tomoki; Kurimoto, Eiji; Oda, Akifumi] Meijo Univ, Grad Sch Pharm, Tempaku Ku, 150 Yagotoyama, Nagoya, Aichi 4688503, Japan; [Kato, Koichi] Kinjo Gakuin Univ, Dept Pharm, Moriyama Ku, 2-1723 Omori, Nagoya, Aichi 4638521, Japan; [Nakayoshi, Tomoki; Fukuyoshi, Shuichi; Oda, Akifumi] Kanazawa Univ, Inst Med Pharmaceut & Hlth Sci, Kakuma Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Oda, Akifumi] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 3-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Oda, A (corresponding author), Meijo Univ, Grad Sch Pharm, Tempaku Ku, 150 Yagotoyama, Nagoya, Aichi 4688503, Japan.; Oda, A (corresponding author), Kanazawa Univ, Inst Med Pharmaceut & Hlth Sci, Kakuma Machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.; Oda, A (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 3-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",144331503@ccalumni.meijo-u.ac.jp; ray-sc76@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; fukuyosi@p.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; kurimoto@meijo-u.ac.jp; oda@meijo-u.ac.jp,"Fukuyoshi, Shuichi/D-8388-2015","Fukuyoshi, Shuichi/0000-0002-9015-0920; Nakayoshi, Tomoki/0000-0002-2905-3611; Kato, Koichi/0000-0001-6984-2343","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17K08257]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K08257] Funding Source: KAKEN","The present study was performed under the Cooperative Research Program of the Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University.

The Stratified-UWHAM equations can be obtained in the form of UWHAM equations but with an expanded set of states. We also provide a stochastic solver, Stratified RE-SWHAM, for Stratified-UWHAM to remove its computational bottleneck. Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM are applied to study three test topics: the free energy landscape of alanine dipeptide, the binding affinity of a host guest binding complex, and path sampling for a two-dimensional double well potential. The examples show that when some of the parallel simulations are only locally equilibrated, the estimates of free energies and equilibrium distributions provided by the conventional UWHAM (or MBAR) solutions exhibit considerable biases, but the estimates provided by Stratified-UWHAM and Stratified RE-SWHAM agree with the benchmark very well. Lastly, we discuss features of the Stratified-UWHAM approach which is based on coarse-graining in relation to two other maximum likelihood based methods which were proposed recently, that also coarse-grain the multicanonical data.","[Zhang, Bin W.; Levy, Ronald M.] Temple Univ, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Zhang, Bin W.; Levy, Ronald M.] Temple Univ, Inst Computat Mol Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Deng, Nanjie] Pace Univ, Dept Chem & Phys Sci, New York, NY 10038 USA; [Tan, Zhiqiang] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Stat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Levy, RM (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Ctr Biophys & Computat Biol, Dept Chem, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.; Levy, RM (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Inst Computat Mol Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",ronlevy@temple.edu,,"Zhang, Bin/0000-0003-3007-4900","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM30580, OD020095]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1665032]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1053575]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580, R01GM030580] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD020095] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by NIH grant (GM30580), NSF grant (1665032), and by an NIH computer equipment grant OD020095.

This finding indicates a possibility that intramolecular charge-charge interactions have not included sufficient dielectric screening effect of the electronic polarization. Scaling down peptide atomic charges according to the optical dielectric constant is tested in this study. As a result, the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds is lower than using unscaled atomic charges while reaching the same levels of helical contents or -hairpin backbone hydrogen bonds, because van der Waals interactions contribute substantially to peptide folding in water. Reducing intramolecular charge-charge interactions and hydrogen bonding increases conformational search efficiency. In particular, it reduces the equilibrium helical content in simulations using AMBER force field and the energy barrier in folding simulations using CHARMM force field.","[Sung, Shen-Shu] Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, R130,R130,500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA","Sung, SS (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Pharmacol, R130,R130,500 Univ Dr, Hershey, PA 17033 USA.",shenshu.sung@gmail.com,,,"College of Medicine, Penn State University","Grant sponsor: College of Medicine, Penn State University.",,57,0,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,OCT,2017,26,10,,,,,2003,2009,,10.1002/pro.3238,,,7,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,FH5BV,WOS:000411179200010,28726339,"Green Published, Bronze",,,19/11/2020

Our analysis focuses on two states previously identified as Fip35 folding intermediates and suggests that a three-stranded core similar to the folded state core is the main source of the spectroscopic differences between the two intermediates. In particular, we propose a hypothesis for why folding via one of these intermediates was not experimentally observed by IR T-jump.","[Zanetti-Polzi, Laura; Daidone, Isabella] Univ Aquila, Dept Phys & Chem Sci, Via Vetoio Coppito 1, I-67010 Laquila, Italy; [Davis, Caitlin M.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem, Champaign, IL USA; [Davis, Caitlin M.; Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Champaign, IL USA; [Gruebele, Martin] Univ Illinois, Ctr Biophys & Quantitat Biol, Champaign, IL USA; [Dyer, R.

In addition to its native structure possessing alpha-helix and beta-sheet contents of 27% and 39%, respectively, we construct a number of misfolded decoys with a wide variety of alpha-helix and beta-sheet contents. We then consider a hierarchy of 8 different models with increasing level of detail in terms of the number of entropic and energetic physical factors incorporated. The polyatomic structure is always taken into account, but the side chains are removed in half of the models. The solvent is formed by either neutral hard spheres or water molecules. Protein intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and protein-solvent H-bonds (the latter is present only in water) are accounted for or not, depending on the model considered. We then apply a physics-based free-energy function (FEF) corresponding to each model and investigate which structures are most stabilized. This special approach taken on a step-by-step basis enables us to clarify the role of each physical factor in contributing to the structural stability and separately elucidate its effect. Depending on the model employed, significantly different structures such as very compact configurations with no secondary structures and configurations of associated alpha-helices are optimally stabilized. The native structure can be identified as that with lowest FEF only when the most detailed model is employed. This result is significant for at least the two reasons: The most detailed model considered here is able to capture the fundamental aspects of protein folding notwithstanding its simplicity; and it is shown that the native structure is stabilized by a complex interplay of minimal multiple factors that must be all included in the description. In the absence of even a single of these factors, the protein is likely to be driven towards a different, more stable state.

The analysis of 15-LOX-2 uses data generated exclusively from biased umbrella sampling simulations carried out at the hybrid ab initio density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) level of theory. In all cases, our method automatically identifies the corresponding transition states and metastable conformations in a variationally optimal way, with the input of a set of relevant coordinates, by accurately reproducing the intrinsic slowest relaxation rate of each system.

Furthermore, the folding of beta-hairpins is a valuable test case for benchmarking experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.

To get insights into the biophysical basis of their different folding mechanisms, we used native-centric models with and without additional transferrable, sequence-dependent nonnative hydrophobic interactions to study the folding behaviors of the Fyn SH3 domain and its mutant. The pure native-centric model predicts that both the wildtype and the mutant fold in a two-state manner, without any detectable intermediate. However, in the simulated trajectories based on the model with sequence-dependent nonnative hydrophobic interactions, a low populated on-pathway intermediate was identified for the mutant, but not for the wild type, although it is not sufficient to induce chevron rollover. In the modelling intermediate, the topology of strands beta(1) to beta(4) followed by the helix turn is native-like, while strand beta(5) is mostly unstructured, which is in good agreement with experiments. Meanwhile, the nonnative contacts in the intermediate overlapped largely with those identified experimentally. Further investigation implies that different folding mechanisms between the wildtype and the mutant might arise from the distinction of the nonnative contact patterns at the transition states. In addition, we predicted that nonnative interactions led to deceleration or acceleration of the folding largely depending on whether they could destabilize or stabilize the transition state relative to the unfolded state. This study implies that the simple native-centric model augmented by sequence-dependent nonnative hydrophobic interactions should be useful in general to predict the folding of proteins with a low-populated intermediate.","[Wu, Jing; Chen, Guojun; Zhang, Ping; Chen, Tao] Northwestern Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Key Lab Synthet & Nat Funct Mol Chem, Minist Educ, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chen, T (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Key Lab Synthet & Nat Funct Mol Chem, Minist Educ, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",tchen@nwu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X",Guangdong Key Laboratory of High Performance & Functional Polymer Materials [20160001]; Fundamental Research Fund for Northwest University [338020014]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31200548]; National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates [201710697013],"This work was supported by the Open Research Fund of Guangdong Key Laboratory of High Performance & Functional Polymer Materials (20160001), the Fundamental Research Fund for Northwest University (338020014), the National Science Foundation of China (31200548), and National Training Programs of Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Undergraduates (201710697013).

Some researchers have found that the predicted residue-residue contacts could effectively constrain the conformational search space, which is significant for de novo protein structure prediction. In the last few decades, related researchers have developed various methods to predict residue-residue contacts, especially, significant performance has been achieved by using fusion methods in recent years. In this work, a novel fusion method based on rank strategy has been proposed to predict contacts. Unlike the traditional regression or classification strategies, the contact prediction task is regarded as a ranking task. First, two kinds of features are extracted from correlated mutations methods and ensemble machine-learning classifiers, and then the proposed method uses the learning-to-rank algorithm to predict contact probability of each residue pair. Results: First, we perform two benchmark tests for the proposed fusion method (RRCRank) on CASP11 dataset and CASP12 dataset respectively. The test results show that the RRCRank method outperforms other well-developed methods, especially for medium and short range contacts. Second, in order to verify the superiority of ranking strategy, we predict contacts by using the traditional regression and classification strategies based on the same features as ranking strategy. Compared with these two traditional strategies, the proposed ranking strategy shows better performance for three contact types, in particular for long range contacts. Third, the proposed RRCRank has been compared with several state-of-the-art methods in CASP11 and CASP12. The results show that the RRCRank could achieve comparable prediction precisions and is better than three methods in most assessment metrics. Conclusions: The learning-to-rank algorithm is introduced to develop a novel rank-based method for the residueresidue contact prediction of proteins, which achieves state-of-the-art performance based on the extensive assessment.","[Jing, Xiaoyang; Lu, Ruqian] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Dong, Qiwen] East China Normal Univ, Sch Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China","Dong, QW (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",qwdong@dase.ecnu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB1000905]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1401256,, 61,672,234, 61,402,177]","This work has been supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant 2016YFB1000905, National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. U1401256, 61,672,234, 61,402,177.",,67,0,0,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2105,,,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,BMC Bioinformatics,Sep-02,2017,18,,,,,,,,390,10.1186/s12859-017-1811-9,,,12,Biochemical Research Methods; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Mathematical & Computational Biology,FF6BU,WOS:000409088900003,28865433,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

The easy parameter setting of GbAMD is demonstrated in a variety of simulation tests for the conformational transitions of proteins with various complexity including the folding of Trpcage, GB1p, and HP35 peptides as well as the functional conformational changes of nCaM and HIV-1 PR proteins. Additionally, the ability of GbAMD in conformational sampling and free-energy evaluation is quantitatively assessed through the comparison of GbAMD simulations on the folding of a-helical Trpcage and beta-hairpin GB1p with the accompanying standard dual boost AMD and conventional MD (cMD) simulations. While GbAMD can fold both peptides into their native structures repeatedly in individual trajectories, AMD can only fold Trpcage and cMD fails the folding in both cases. As a result, only GbAMD can quantitatively measure the properties of the equilibrium conformational ensemble of protein folding consistent with experimental data. Also notable is that the structural properties of the indispensable unfolded and transition states in the folding pathways of Trpcage and GB1p characterized by GbAMD simulations are in great agreement with previous simulations on the two peptides. In summary, GbAMD has an effective conformational sampling ability that provides a convenient and effective access for simulating the structural dynamics of biomolecular systems.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.; Shao, Q (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) [U1501501],"We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21373258), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) under Grant No. U1501501 for financial support.

It is thus important to be able to calculate, for example, both the affinity and rate of binding and dissociation of a protein-ligand complex, or the populations and exchange rates between distinct conformational states. Because these are typically rare events, calculating these properties from long molecular dynamics simulations remains extremely difficult. Instead, one often adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy in which equilibrium free-energy differences and the fastest state-to-state transition (e.g. ligand association or minor-to-major state conversion) are combined to estimate the slow rate (e.g. ligand dissociation) using a two-state assumption. Here we instead address these problems by using a previously developed method to calculate both the forward and backward rates directly from simulations. We then estimate the thermodynamics from the rates, and validate these values by independent means. We applied the approach to three systems of increasing complexity, including the association and dissociation of benzene to a fully buried cavity inside the L99A mutant variant of T4 lysozyme. In particular, we were able to determine both millisecond association and dissociation rates, and the affinity, of the protein-ligand system by directly observing dozens of rare events in atomic detail. Our approach both sheds light on the precision of methods for calculating kinetics and further provides a generally useful test for the internal consistency of kinetics and thermodynamics. We also expect our route to be useful for obtaining both the kinetics and thermodynamics at the same time in more challenging cases.","[Wang, Yong; Martins, Joao Miguel; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark","Lindorff-Larsen, K (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Struct Biol & NMR Lab, Linderstrom Lang Ctr Prot Sci, Ole Maaloes Vej 5, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.",lindorff@bio.ku.dk,"Wang, Yong/J-3990-2012; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten/K-6469-2014; M.

Miniproteins offer possibilities for reducing the complexity of larger proteins and so present new routes to studying sequence-to-structure and sequence-to-stability relationships in proteins generally. They also provide modules for protein design by pieces and, with this, prospects for building more-complex or even entirely new protein structures. In addition, miniproteins are useful scaffolds for templating functional domains, for example, those involved in protein-protein interactions, catalysis, and biomolecular binding, leading to potential applications in biotechnology and medicine. Here we select examples from almost four decades of miniprotein design, development, and dissection. Simply because of the word limit for this Account, we focus on miniproteins that are cooperatively folded monomers in solution and not stabilized by cross-linking or metal binding. In these cases, the optimization of noncovalent interactions is even more critical for the maintenance of the folded states than in larger proteins. Our chronology and catalogue highlights themes in miniproteins, which we explore further and begin to put on a firmer footing through an analysis of the miniprotein structures that have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) thus far. Specifically, and compared with larger proteins, miniproteins generally have a lower proportion of residues in regular secondary structure elements (alpha helices, beta strands, and polyproline-II helices) and, concomitantly, more residues in well-structured loops. This allows distortions of the backbone enabling mini-hydrophobic cores to be made. This also contrasts with larger proteins, which can achieve hydrophobic cores through tertiary contacts between distant regions of sequence. On average, miniproteins have a higher proportion of aromatic residues than larger proteins, and specifically electron-rich Trp and Tyr, which are often found in combination with Pro and Arg to render networks of CH-pi or cation-pi interactions. Miniproteins also have a higher proportion of the long-chain charged amino acids (Arg, Glu, and Lys), which presumably reflects salt-bridge formation and their greater surface area-to-volume ratio. Together, these amino-acid preferences appear to support greater densities of noncovalent interactions in miniproteins compared with larger proteins. We anticipate that with recent developments such as parametric protein design, it will become increasingly routine to use computation to generate and evaluate models for miniproteins in silico ahead of experimental studies. This could include accessing new structures comprising secondary structure elements linked in previously unseen configurations. The improved understanding of the noncovalent interactions that stabilize the folded states of such miniproteins that we are witnessing through both in-depth bioinformatics analyses and experimental testing will feed these computational protein designs. With this in mind, we can expect a new and exciting era for miniprotein design, study, and application.","[Baker, Emily G.; Bartlett, Gail J.; Goff, Kathryn L.

These polaritons are coherent superpositions (in the quantum mechanical sense) of excitations of the molecules and of the cavity photon or surface plasmon. Recent experimental and theoretical works suggest that access to these polaritons in cavities could provide a totally new and attractive paradigm for controlling chemical reactions that falls in between traditional chemical catalysis and coherent laser control. However, designing cavity parameters to control chemistry requires a theoretical model with which the effect of the light-matter coupling on the molecular dynamics can be predicted accurately. Here we present a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation model for photoactive molecules that are strongly coupled to confined light in optical cavities or surface plasmons. Using this model we have performed simulations with up to 1600 Rhodamine molecules in a cavity. The results of these simulations reveal that the contributions of the molecules to the polariton are time-dependent due to thermal fluctuations that break symmetry. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that in addition to the cavity quality factor, also the Stokes shift and number of molecules control the lifetime of the polariton. Because large numbers of molecules interacting with confined light can now be simulated in atomic detail, we anticipate that our method will lead to a better understanding of the effects of strong coupling on chemical reactivity. Ultimately the method may even be used to systematically design cavities to control photochemistry.","[Luk, Hoi Ling; Groenhof, Gerrit] Univ Jyvaskyla, Nanosci Ctr, Dept Chem, POB 35, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland; [Toppari, J.

One of the challenges inherent in targeting these pathogens with drugs is the tight integration of the viral life cycle with the host's cellular machinery. However, the reliance of the virus on the host cell replication machinery is also an opportunity for therapeutic targeting, as successful entry- and exit-inhibitors have demonstrated. An understanding of the extracellular and intracellular structure and dynamics of the virion as well as of the entry and exit pathways in host and vector cells is therefore crucial to the advancement of novel antivirals. In recent years, advances in computing architecture and algorithms have begun to allow us to use simulations to study the structure and dynamics of viral ultrastructures at various stages of their life cycle in atomistic or near-atomistic detail. In this review, we outline specific challenges and solutions that have emerged to allow for structurally detailed modelling of viruses in silico. We focus on the history and state of the art of atomistic and coarse-grained approaches to simulate the dynamics of the large, macromolecular structures associated with viral infection, and on their usefulness in explaining and expanding upon experimental data. We discuss the types of interactions that need to be modeled to describe major components of the virus particle and advances in modelling techniques that allow for the treatment of these systems, highlighting recent key simulation studies.

The problem arises from the exponential scaling of the computational searching and sampling of large conformational spaces. This scaling challenge is not met by today's methods, such as Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or molecular dynamics (MD) or its variants such as replica exchange. Such methods of searching for optimal states on complex probabilistic landscapes are referred to more broadly as Explore-and-Exploit (EE), including in contexts such as computational learning, games, industrial planning, and modeling military strategies. Here, we describe a Bayesian method, called MELD, that 'melds' together EE approaches with externally added information that can be vague, combinatoric, noisy, intuitive, heuristic, or from experimental data. MELD is shown to accelerate physical MD simulations when using experimental data to determine protein structures; for predicting protein structures by using heuristic directives; and when predicting binding affinities of proteins from limited information about the binding site. Such Guided EE approaches might also be useful beyond proteins and beyond molecular science.

These fast fluctuations guide protein conformational changes, yet their role for protein stability, and for unfolding, remains elusive. Here, in analogy with the Lindemann criterion for the melting of solids, we demonstrate a common scaling of structural fluctuations of lysozyme protein embedded in different environments as the thermal unfolding transition is approached. By combining elastic incoherent neutron scattering and advanced molecular simulations, we show that, although different solvents modify the protein melting temperature, a unique dynamical regime is attained in proximity of thermal unfolding in all solvents that we tested. This solvation shell-independent dynamical regime arises from an equivalent sampling of the energy landscape at the respective melting temperatures. Thus, we propose that a threshold for the conformational entropy provided by structural fluctuations of proteins exists, beyond which thermal unfolding is triggered.","[Katava, Marina; Stirnemann, Guillaume; Sterpone, Fabio] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Biochim Theor, Inst Biol Physicochim, CNRS Unite Propre Rech 9080,Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75005 Paris, France; [Zanatta, Marco] Univ Verona, Dipartimento Informat, I-37134 Verona, Italy; [Capaccioli, Simone; Pachetti, Maria; Ngai, K.

This has been a challenging question to address experimentally as single-molecule studies are constrained by the limited number of observed folding events while ensemble measurements, by definition, report only an average and not the distribution of the quantity under study. Atomistic simulations, on the other hand, are restricted by sampling and the inability to reproduce thermodynamic observables directly. We overcome these bottlenecks in the current work and provide a quantitative description of folding pathway heterogeneity by developing a comprehensive, scalable and yet experimentally consistent approach combining concepts from statistical mechanics, physical kinetics and graph theory. We quantify the folding pathway heterogeneity of five single-domain proteins under two thermodynamic conditions from an analysis of 100 000 folding events generated from a statistical mechanical model incorporating the detailed energetics from more than a million conformational states. The resulting microstate energetics predicts the results of protein engineering experiments, the thermodynamic stabilities of secondary-structure segments from NMR studies, and the end-to-end distance estimates from single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements. We find that a minimum of similar to 3-200 microscopic routes, with a diverse ensemble of transition-path structures, are required to account for the total folding flux across the five proteins and the thermodynamic conditions. The partitioning of flux amongst the numerous pathways is shown to be subtly dependent on the experimental conditions that modulate protein stability, topological complexity and the structural resolution at which the folding events are observed. Our predictive methodology thus reveals the presence of rich ensembles of folding mechanisms that are generally invisible in experiments, reconciles the contradictory observations from experiments and simulations and provides an experimentally consistent avenue to quantify folding heterogeneity.","[Gopi, Soundhararajan; Naganathan, Athi N.] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Singh, Animesh; Paul, Suvadip; Ranu, Sayan] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Suresh, Swaathiratna] Anna Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, Chennai 600025, Tamil Nadu, India","Naganathan, AN (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta Sch Biosci, Dept Biotechnol, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.; Ranu, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.",sayan@cse.iitm.ac.in; athi@iitm.ac.in,,"Naganathan, Athi N/0000-0002-1655-7802; Gopi, Soundhara Rajan/0000-0002-7511-2571",,,,87,8,8,2,10,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9076,1463-9084,,PHYS CHEM CHEM PHYS,Phys.

Especially poorly understood are the very early stages of protein folding, which are likely defined by intrinsic local interactions between amino acids close to each other in the protein sequence. We here present EFoldMine, a method that predicts, from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which amino acids are likely involved in early folding events. The method is based on early folding data from hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) data from NMR pulsed labelling experiments, and uses backbone and sidechain dynamics as well as secondary structure propensities as features. The EFoldMine predictions give insights into the folding process, as illustrated by a qualitative comparison with independent experimental observations. Furthermore, on a quantitative proteome scale, the predicted early folding residues tend to become the residues that interact the most in the folded structure, and they are often residues that display evolutionary covariation. The connection of the EFoldMine predictions with both folding pathway data and the folded protein structure suggests that the initial statistical behavior of the protein chain with respect to local structure formation has a lasting effect on its subsequent states.","[Raimondi, Daniele; Orlando, Gabriele; Khan, Taushif; Vranken, Wim F.] ULB VUB, Interuniv Inst Bioinformat Brussels, BC Bldg,6th Floor,CP 263, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Raimondi, Daniele; Orlando, Gabriele] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Machine Learning Grp, Blvd Triomphe,CP 212, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Raimondi, Daniele; Orlando, Gabriele; Khan, Taushif; Vranken, Wim F.] VIB, Ctr Struct Biol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Raimondi, Daniele; Orlando, Gabriele; Khan, Taushif; Vranken, Wim F.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Pancsa, Rita] MRC, Lab Mol Biol, Francis Crick Ave,Cambridge Biomed Campus, Cambridge CB2 0QH, England","Vranken, WF (corresponding author), ULB VUB, Interuniv Inst Bioinformat Brussels, BC Bldg,6th Floor,CP 263, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Vranken, WF (corresponding author), VIB, Ctr Struct Biol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.; Vranken, WF (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Struct Biol Brussels, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",wvranken@vub.ac.be,"Vranken, Wim F/J-5051-2016","Vranken, Wim F/0000-0001-7470-4324; khan, taushif/0000-0002-7917-8965",EMBO long-term fellowshipEuropean Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) [ALTF 702-2015]; Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) projectFWO [FWOAL796]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Union (EU); Brussels-Capital Region within Operational Programme through the ERDF-project ICITY-RDI.BRU; Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_U105185859] Funding Source: researchfish,R.P. is supported by an EMBO long-term fellowship (ALTF 702-2015).

However, proteins are not static structures as often inferred from crystallo-graphic structures. Their components move and breathe individually and collectively over a range of timescales. Peptides bound within MHC peptide-binding grooves are no exception and their motions have been shown to impact recognition by T cell and other receptors in ways that influence function. Furthermore, peptides tune the motions of MHC proteins themselves, which impacts recognition of peptide/MHC complexes by other proteins. Here, we review the motional properties of peptides in MHC binding grooves and discuss how peptide properties can influence MHC motions. We briefly review theoretical concepts about protein motion and highlight key data that illustrate immunological consequences. We focus primarily on class I systems due to greater availability of data, but segue into class II systems as the concepts and consequences overlap.

The free energy surfaces underlying these processes can be obtained from simulations using enhanced sampling methods. However, their altered dynamics makes kinetic and mechanistic information difficult or impossible to extract. Here, we show that, with replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), one can not only sample equilibrium properties but also extract kinetic information. For systems that strictly obey first-order kinetics, the procedure to extract rates is rigorous. For actual molecular systems whose long-time dynamics are captured by kinetic rate models, accurate rate, coefficients can be determined from the statistics of the transitions between the metastable states at each replica temperature. We demonstrate the practical applicability of the procedure by constructing master equation (Markov state) models of peptide and RNA folding from REMD simulations.","[Stelzl, Lukas S.; Hummer, Gerhard] Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hummer, Gerhard] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany","Hummer, G (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biophys, Dept Theoret Biophys, Max von Laue Str 3, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.; Hummer, G (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Biophys, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.",gerhard.hummer@biophys.mpg.de,"Hummer, Gerhard/A-2546-2013","Hummer, Gerhard/0000-0001-7768-746X; Stelzl, Lukas/0000-0002-5348-0277",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC902]; Max Planck SocietyMax Planck Society,"We acknowledge financial support from the German Research Foundation (CRC902: Molecular Principles of RNA Based Regulation) and by the Max Planck Society.

A basic tenet of the energy landscape model is that proteins fold through many heterogeneous pathways by way of amino acid-level dynamics biased toward selecting native-like interactions. The many pathways imagined in the model are not observed in the structure-formation stage of folding by experiments that would have found them, but they have now been detected and characterized for one protein in the initial prenucleation stage. Analysis presented here shows that these many microscopic trajectories are not distinct in any functionally significant way, and they have neither the structural information nor the biased energetics needed to select native vs. nonnative interactions during folding. The opposed defined-pathway model stems from experimental results that show that proteins are assemblies of small cooperative units called foldons and that a number of proteins fold in a reproducible pathway one foldon unit at a time. Thus, the same foldon interactions that encode the native structure of any given protein also naturally encode its particular foldon-based folding pathway, and they collectively sum to produce the energy bias toward native interactions that is necessary for efficient folding. Available information suggests that quantized native structure and stepwise folding coevolved in ancient repeat proteins and were retained as a functional pair due to their utility for solving the difficult protein folding problem.","[Englander, S.

The GUI allows: defining interactively new CVs; partitioning the configurations into microstates characterized by similar values of the CVs; calculating the free energies of the microstates for both unbiased and biased (metadynamics) simulations; clustering the microstates in kinetic basins; visualizing the free energy landscape as a function of a subset of the CVs used for the analysis. A simple mouse click allows one to quickly inspect structures corresponding to specific points in the landscape.

Despite many recent improvements of classical protein force fields, there are remaining key issues: much weaker temperature dependence of folding/unfolding equilibrium and overly collapsed unfolded or disordered states. For the latter problem, a new water model (TIP4P-D) has been proposed to correct the significantly underestimated water dispersion interactions. Here, using TIP4P-D, we reveal problems in current force fields through failures in folding model systems (a polyalanine peptide, Trp-cage, and the GB1 hairpin). By using residue-specific parameters to achieve better match between amino acid sequences and native structures and adding a small H-bond correction to partially compensate the missing many-body effects in a-helix formation, the new RSFF2+ force field with the TIP4P-D water model can excellently reproduce experimental melting curves of both alpha-helical and beta-hairpin systems. The RSFF2+/TIP4P-D method also gives less collapsed unfolded structures and describes well folded proteins simultaneously.","[Wu, Hao-Nan; Jiang, Fan; Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Dong] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Jiang, F (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Lab Chem Genom, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",jiangfan@pku.edu.cn,"Wu, Yun-Dong/G-8463-2013",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21573009],We acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21573009).

The algorithm guarantees sampling of the underlying ensemble in dependency of one average linear coupling factor ha <alpha >tau. We test the validity of the kinetics in simulations of dialanine and compare dihedral transition kinetics with long-time MD-simulations. We find that for low hait values, kinetics are in good quantitative agreement. In folding simulations of TrpCage and TrpZip4 in explicit solvent, we also find good quantitative agreement with experimental results and prior MD/kMC simulations. Finally, we apply our algorithm to study growth of the Alzheimer Amyloid Ab 16- 22 fibril by monomer addition.

Although these forces are encoded in the thousands of known protein structures, decoding them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds-a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.","[Rocklin, Gabriel J.; Chidyausiku, Tamuka M.; Goreshnik, Inna; Ford, Alex; Carter, Lauren; Ravichandran, Rashmi; Mulligan, Vikram K.; Chevalier, Aaron; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rocklin, Gabriel J.; Chidyausiku, Tamuka M.; Goreshnik, Inna; Ford, Alex; Carter, Lauren; Ravichandran, Rashmi; Mulligan, Vikram K.; Chevalier, Aaron; Baker, David] Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chidyausiku, Tamuka M.; Ford, Alex] Univ Washington, Grad Program Biol Phys Struct & Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Houliston, Scott; Lemak, Alexander; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Houliston, Scott; Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Struct Genom Consortium, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Arrowsmith, Cheryl H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Baker, David] Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Baker, D (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biochem, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Baker, D (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Inst Prot Design, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.; Baker, D (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Howard Hughes Med Inst, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dabaker@u.washington.edu,,"Chidyausiku, Tamuka/0000-0002-2561-782X; Mulligan, Vikram/0000-0001-6038-8922; Arrowsmith, Cheryl/0000-0002-4971-3250; Rocklin, Gabriel/0000-0003-2253-5631","Howard Hughes Medical InstituteHoward Hughes Medical Institute; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR; AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG; Boehringer IngelheimBoehringer Ingelheim; Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; Eshelman Institute for Innovation; Genome Canada through Ontario Genomics InstituteGenome Canada [OGI-055]; Innovative Medicines Initiative (EU/EFPIA) through ULTRA-DD [115766]; Janssen PharmaceuticalsJohnson & Johnson USAJanssen Biotech Inc; Merck Co.Merck & Company; Novartis Pharma AG; Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science (MRIS); PfizerPfizer; Sao Paulo Research Foundation-FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); TakedaTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust","Supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (D.B.) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (C.H.A.).

However, using this relationship in a predictive context remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that, starting from a given protein conformer, it is possible to generate in a single step model conformers that are less than 1 angstrom (C-alpha-RMSD) from the conformer which is the known endpoint of the conformational change, particularly when the conformational change is collective in nature. Such accurate model conformers can be generated by following either the so-called robust or the 50 lowest-frequency modes obtained with various Elastic Network Models (ENMs). Interestingly, the quality of many of these models compares well with actual crystal structures, as assessed by the ROSETTA scoring function and PROCHECK. The most accurate and best quality conformers obtained in the present study were generated by using the 50 lowest-frequency modes of an all-atom ENM. However, with less than ten robust modes, which are identified without any prior knowledge of the nature of the conformational change, nearly 90% of the motion described by the 50 lowest-frequency modes of a protein can be captured. Such results strongly suggest that exploring the robust modes of ENMs may prove efficient for sampling the functionally relevant conformational repertoire of many proteins.

Recently it has been suggested that mechanical vibrations play a crucial role in controlling structural configuration changes (folding) which govern proteins biological function. The mechanism behind protein folding is still not completely understood, and many efforts are being made to investigate this phenomenon. Complex molecular dynamics simulations and sophisticated experimental measurements are conducted to investigate protein dynamics and to perform protein structure predictions; however, these are two related, although quite distinct, approaches. Here we investigate mechanical vibrations of lysozyme by Raman spectroscopy and linear normal mode calculations (modal analysis). The input mechanical parameters to the numerical computations are taken from the literature. We first give an estimate of the order of magnitude of protein vibration frequencies by considering both classical wave mechanics and structural dynamics formulas. Afterwards, we perform modal analyses of some relevant chemical groups and of the full lysozyme protein. The numerical results are compared to experimental data, obtained from both in-house and literature Raman measurements. In particular, the attention is focused on a large peak at 0.84 THz (29.3 cm(-1)) in the Raman spectrum obtained analyzing a lyophilized powder sample. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this, it is difficult to investigate protein dynamics due to the rapid timescale at which they sample their conformational space, leading most NMR-determined structures to represent only an averaged snapshot of the dynamic picture. While NMR relaxation measurements can help to determine local dynamics, it is difficult to detect translational or concerted motion, and only recently have significant advances been made to make it possible to acquire a more holistic representation of the dynamics and structural landscapes of proteins. Here, we briefly revisit our most recent progress in the theory and use of exact nuclear Overhauser enhancements (eNOEs) for the calculation of structural ensembles that describe their conformational space. New developments are primarily targeted at increasing the number and improving the quality of extracted eNOE distance restraints, such that the multi-state structure calculation can be applied to proteins of higher molecular weights. We then review the implications of the exact NOE to the protein dynamics and function of cyclophilin A and the WW domain of Pin1, and finally discuss our current research and future directions.","[Nichols, Parker J.; Born, Alexandra; Henen, Morkos A.; Vogeli, Beat] Univ Colorado, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Anschutz Med Campus,12801 East 17th Ave, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Henen, Morkos A.] Mansoura Univ, Fac Pharm, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Strotz, Dean; Orts, Julien; Guentert, Peter] ETH, Lab Phys Chem, ETH Honggerberg, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Olsson, Simon] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arnimallee 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Guentert, Peter] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Am Main, Ctr Biomol Magnet Resonance, Inst Biophys Chem, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Guentert, Peter] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Chi, Celestine N.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Med Biochem & Microbiol, BMC Box 582, SE-75123 Uppsala, Sweden","Vogeli, B (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Anschutz Med Campus,12801 East 17th Ave, Aurora, CO 80045 USA.",parker.nichols@ucdenver.edu; alexandra.born@ucdenver.edu; morkos.henen@ucdenver.edu; dean.strotz@phys.chem.ethz.ch; julien.orts@phys.chem.ethz.ch; solsson@zedat.fu-berlin.de; guentert@em.uni-frankfurt.de; chi.celestine@imbim.uu.se; beat.vogeli@ucdenver.edu,"orts, julien/V-5511-2017; Orts, Julien/AAL-6556-2020; Henen, Morkos/M-5995-2018; Olsson, Simon/O-5804-2019; Faculty of Biochemistry, Chemistry/AAR-2127-2020","orts, julien/0000-0003-3287-1532; Orts, Julien/0000-0003-3287-1532; Henen, Morkos/0000-0003-4835-5583; Olsson, Simon/0000-0002-3927-7897; Nichols, Parker/0000-0003-1930-6408; Vogeli, Beat/0000-0003-1176-3137; Born, Alexandra/0000-0001-8258-0982",start-up package from the University of Colorado at Denver; FU Berlin and European Commission (DRS POINT-Marie Curie COFUND postdoctoral fellowship); Wenner-Gren foundation [WG-17],"This work was supported by a start-up package from the University of Colorado at Denver to B.V., S.O. acknowledges funding from FU Berlin and European Commission (DRS POINT-Marie Curie COFUND postdoctoral fellowship), and C.C. by the Wenner-Gren foundation WG-17 returning grants to C.N.C.",,67,10,10,0,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,JUL,2017,22,7,,,,,,,1176,10.3390/molecules22071176,,,17,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,FC1TT,WOS:000406621300150,28708092,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,19/11/2020

Although conventional single-molecule approaches can detect folding intermediates, they presently lack throughput and require elaborate labeling. Here, we theoretically show that measurements of ionic current through a nanopore containing a protein can report on the protein's folding state. Our all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the unfolding of a protein lowers the nanopore ionic current, an effect that originates from the reduction of ion mobility in proximity to a protein. Using a theoretical model, we show that the average change in ionic current produced by a folding unfolding transition is detectable despite the orientational and conformational heterogeneity of the folded and unfolded states. By analyzing millisecond-long all-atom MD simulations of multiple protein transitions, we show that a nanopore ionic current recording can detect folding unfolding transitions in real time and report on the structure of folding intermediates.","[Si, Wei; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Si, Wei] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Design & Manufacture Micro Nano B, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Si, Wei] Southeast Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",aksiment@illinois.edu,"Si, Wei/N-4576-2018","Si, Wei/0000-0001-7285-058X; Aksimentiev, Aleksei/0000-0002-6042-8442","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01-HG007406]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [CSC201506090040]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51435003]; NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) [R01HG007406, R01HG007406, R01HG007406, R01HG007406] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (R01-HG007406).

MD offers extraordinary insights into the structures and dynamics of biological systems. With the current capabilities of high-performance supercomputers, it is now possible to perform MD simulations of systems as large as millions of atoms and for several nanoseconds timescale. Nevertheless, many complicated molecular mechanisms, including ligand binding/unbinding and protein folding, usually take place on timescales of several microseconds to milliseconds, which are beyond the practical limits of standard MD simulations. Such issues with traditional MD approaches can be effectively tackled with new generation MD methods, such as enhanced sampling MD approaches and coarse-grained MD (CG-MD) scheme. The former employ a bias to steer the simulations and reveal biological events that are usually very slow, while the latter groups atoms as interaction beads, thereby reducing the system size and facilitating longer MD simulations that can witness large conformational changes in biological systems. In this review, we outline many of such advanced MD methods, and discuss how their applications are providing significant insights into important biological processes, particularly those relevant to drug design and discovery.

Here we determined the equilibrium ensembles generated by the four atomistic OPLS-AA, CHARMM22*, AMBER99sb-ildn, and AMBERsb14 force fields with the TIP3P water model. On the basis of 144 mu s replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations (with 750 ns per replica), we find that the four force fields lead to random coil ensembles with calculated cross-collision sections, hydrodynamics properties, and small-angle X-ray scattering profiles independent of the force field. There are, however, marked differences in secondary structure, with the AMBERsb14 and CHARMM22* ensembles overestimating the CD-derived helix content, and the OPLS-AA and AMBER99sb-ildn secondary structure contents in agreement with CD data. Also the intramolecular beta-hairpin content spanning residues 1721 and 3036 varies between 1.5% and 13%. Overall, there are significant differences in tertiary and quaternary conformations among all force fields, and the key finding, irrespective of the force field, is that the dimer is stabilized by nonspecific interactions, explaining therefore its possible transient binding to multiple cellular partners and, in part, its toxicity.","[Viet Hoang Man] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Nguyen, Phuong H.; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, IBPC, Lab Biochim Theor,UPR 9080 CNRS, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France","Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, IBPC, Lab Biochim Theor,UPR 9080 CNRS, 13 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France.",philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019; viet, man/ABD-9247-2020","viet, man/0000-0002-8907-6479; DERREUMAUX, Philippe/0000-0001-9110-5585","Initiative d'Excellence program from the French State (Grant DYNAMO) [ANR-11-LABX-0011-01]; National Institute of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NIH-R01GM118508]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [SI2-SEE-1534941]; IDRIS center [x2016077604]; CINES center [x2016077604]; TGCC center [x2016077604];  [GRAL ANR SIMI 12-BS07-0017-01]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & EnginrNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) [1534941] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM118508, R01GM118508, R01GM118508, R01GM118508] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by grants from GRAL ANR SIMI 12-BS07-0017-01, the Initiative d'Excellence program from the French State (Grant DYNAMO, ANR-11-LABX-0011-01), National Institute of Health (NIH-R01GM118508), National Science Foundation (NSF, SI2-SEE-1534941), and computer facilities provided by the NC state HPC, and the IDRIS, CINES and TGCC centers (grant x2016077604).",,81,59,59,4,37,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

Cluster analysis has also verified that these folded structures with the highest population are in good agreement with their corresponding native structures for these proteins. In addition, the free energy landscape of seven proteins in the two dimensional space comprised of RMSD and radius of gyration proved that these folded structures are indeed of the lowest energy conformations. However, when the corresponding simulations were performed using the standard (nonpolarizable) AMBER force fields, no stable folded structures were observed for these proteins.

Yet almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks. Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in the field, including quantitative structure activity relationship, virtual screening, protein structure prediction, quantum chemistry, materials design, and property prediction. In reviewing the performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research topics, and deep neural network-based models often exceeded the glass ceiling expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.

Implicit treatment of solvation, such as using the generalized Born (GB) class of models arguably provides an optimal balance between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. Yet, GB models are frequently plagued by a tendency to generate overly compact structures. The physical origins of this drawback are relatively well understood, and the key to a balanced implicit solvent protein force field is careful optimization of physical parameters to achieve a sufficient level of cancellation of errors. The latter has been hampered by the difficulty of generating converged conformational ensembles of non-trivial model proteins using the popular replica exchange sampling technique. Here, we leverage improved sampling efficiency of a newly developed multi-scale enhanced sampling technique to re-optimize the generalized-Born with molecular volume (GBMV2) implicit solvent model with the CHARMM36 protein force field. Recursive optimization of key GBMV2 parameters (such as input radii) and protein torsion profiles (via the CMAP torsion cross terms) has led to a more balanced GBMV2 protein force field that recapitulates the structures and stabilities of both helical and -hairpin model peptides.

Recent experimental and simulation results reveal the influence of aqueous ionic liquids on the stability of protein and enzyme structures. Depending on different parameters like the concentration and the ion composition, one can observe distinct stabilization or denaturation mechanisms for various ILs. In this review, we summarize the main findings and discuss the implications with regard to molecular theories of solutions and specific ion effects. A preferential binding model is introduced in order to discuss protein-IL effects from a statistical mechanics perspective. The value of the preferential binding coefficient determines the strength of the ion influence and indicates a shift of the chemical equilibrium either to the native or the denatured state of the protein. We highlight the role of water in order to explain the self-association behavior of the IL species and discuss recent experimental and simulation results in the light of the observed binding effects.","[Smiatek, Jens] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Computat Phys, Allmandring 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Smiatek, J (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Computat Phys, Allmandring 3, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",smiatek@icp.uni-stuttgart.de,"Smiatek, Jens/G-9933-2012; Smiatek, Jens/AAV-9135-2020","Smiatek, Jens/0000-0002-3821-0690; Smiatek, Jens/0000-0002-3821-0690",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Sonderforschungsbereich 716 (SFB 716)]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through cluster of excellence initiative Simulation Technology [EXC 310],"The author has benefited from numerous valuable discussions with Volker Lesch, Diddo Diddens, Frank Uhlig, Johannes Zeman, Julian Michalowsky, Anand Narayanan Krishnamoorthy, Takeshi Kobayashi, Florian Dommert, Alexander Weyman, Maria Fyta, Luis M.

Meanwhile, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with physics-based all-atom force fields have been applied successfully to simulate folding/unfolding transitions for several small, fast-folding proteins. To explore the degree to which coarse-grained Go-like models and their extensions to incorporate nonnative interactions are capable of producing folding processes similar to those in all-atom MD simulations, here we systematically compare the computed unfolded states, transition states, and transition paths obtained using coarse-grained models and all-atom explicit-solvent MD simulations. The conformations in the unfolded state in common Go models are more extended, and are thus more in line with experiment, than those from all-atom MD simulations. Nevertheless, the structural features of transition states obtained by the two types of models are largely similar. In contrast, the folding transition paths are significantly more sensitive to modeling details. In particular, when common Go-like models are augmented with nonnative interactions, the predicted dimensions of the unfolded conformations become similar to those computed using all-atom MD. With this connection, the large deviations of all-atom MD from simple diffusion theory are likely caused in part by the presence of significant nonnative effects in folding processes modelled by current atomic force fields. The ramifications of our findings to the application of coarse-grained modeling to more complex biomolecular systems are discussed.","[Hu, Jie; Wang, Moye; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Northwest Univ Xian, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Chan, Hue Sun; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; [Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Chan, HS; Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.; Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Mol Genet, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu; zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,"Zhang, Zhuqing/B-6804-2016","Zhang, Zhuqing/0000-0003-3514-834X; CHAN, Hue Sun/0000-0002-1381-923X",National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31200548]; President Foundation A of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-84281],"We thank David E.

The channels of NMDARs are permeable to Ca2+ but blocked by Mg2+, distinctive properties that underlie essential brain processes such as induction of synaptic plasticity. However, due to limited structural information about the NMDAR transmembrane ion channel forming domain, the mechanism of divalent cation permeation and block is understood poorly. In this paper we developed an atomistic model of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits (GluN1/2A receptors). The model was generated using (a) a homology model based on the structure of the NaK channel and a partially resolved structure of an AMPA receptor (AMPAR), and (b) a partially resolved X-ray structure of GluN1/2B NMDARs. Refinement and extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the NMDAR TMD model were performed in explicit lipid bilayer membrane and water. Targeted MD with simulated annealing was introduced to promote structure refinement. Putative positions of the Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions in the ion channel divalent cation binding site are proposed. Differences in the structural and dynamic behavior of the channel protein in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ are analyzed. NMDAR protein conformational flexibility was similar with no ion bound to the divalent cation binding site and with Ca2+ bound, whereas Mg2+ binding reduced protein fluctuations. While bound at the binding site both ions retained their preferred ligand coordination numbers: 6 for Mg2+, and 7-8 for Ca2+. Four asparagine side chain oxygens, a back-bone oxygen, and a water molecule participated in binding a Mg2+ ion. The Ca2+ ion first coordination shell ligands typically included four to five side-chain oxygen atoms of the binding site asparagine residues, two water molecules and zero to two backbone oxygens of the GluN2B subunits. These results demonstrate the importance of high-resolution channel structures for elucidation of mechanisms of NMDAR permeation and block.","[Mesbahi-Vasey, Samaneh; Veras, Lea; Yonkunas, Michael; Kurnikova, Maria G.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, 4400 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Johnson, Jon W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Johnson, Jon W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Neurosci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Kurnikova, MG (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, 4400 5th Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",kurnikova@cmu.edu,"Yonkunas, Michael/P-8397-2019; Kurnikova, maria/H-4510-2017; Veras, Lea/P-4295-2015","Yonkunas, Michael/0000-0002-4570-279X; Kurnikova, maria/0000-0002-8010-8374; Veras, Lea/0000-0002-6785-6722","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH045817]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817, R01MH045817] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; Division Of Mathematical SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1563291] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was funded by grant R01MH045817 (to JWJ and MK) from the National Institute of Mental Health (https://www.nimh.nih.gov).

CHARMM-GUI creates input files for a number of programs including CHARMM, NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, GENESIS, LAMMPS, Desmond, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM. Since its original development in 2006, CHARMM-GUI has been widely adopted for various purposes and now contains a number of different modules designed to set up a broad range of simulations: (1) PDB Reader & Manipulator, Glycan Reader, and Ligand Reader & Modeler for reading and modifying molecules; (2) Quick MD Simulator, Membrane Builder, Nanodisc Builder, HMMM Builder, Monolayer Builder, Micelle Builder, and Hex Phase Builder for building all-atom simulation systems in various environments; (3) PACE CG Builder and Martini Maker for building coarse-grained simulation systems; (4) DEER Facilitator and MDFF/xMDFF Utilizer for experimentally guided simulations; (5) Implicit Solvent Modeler, PBEQ-Solver, and GCMC/BD Ion Simulator for implicit solvent related calculations; (6) Ligand Binder for ligand solvation and binding free energy simulations; and (7) Drude Prepper for preparation of simulations with the CHARMM Drude polarizable force field. Recently, new modules have been integrated into CHARMM-GUI, such as Glycolipid Modeler for generation of various glycolipid structures, and LPS Modeler for generation of lipopolysaccharide structures from various Gram-negative bacteria. These new features together with existing modules are expected to facilitate advanced molecular modeling and simulation thereby leading to an improved understanding of the structure and dynamics of complex biomolecular systems. Here, we briefly review these capabilities and discuss potential future directions in the CHARMM-GUI development project.

The minima can be escaped using an enhanced sampling method such as metadynamics, which apply bias (i.e., importance sampling) along a set of collective variables (CV), but the maximum number of CVs (or dimensions) is severely limited. We propose a high-dimensional bias potential method (NN2B) based on two machine learning algorithms: the nearest neighbor density estimator (NNDE) and the artificial neural network (ANN) for the bias potential approximation. The bias potential is constructed iteratively from short biased MD simulations accounting for correlation among CVs. Our method is capable of achieving ergodic sampling and calculating free energy of polypeptides with up to 8-dimensional bias potential.","[Galvelis, Raimondas; Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN, Theoret Mol Sci Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN, Adv Inst Computat Sci, Chuo Ku, Integrated Inovat Bldg 7F, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN iTHES, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Sugita, Yuji] RIKEN, Quantitat Biol Ctr, Integrated Inovat Bldg 7F, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Galvelis, R (corresponding author), RIKEN, Theoret Mol Sci Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.",raimondas.galvelis@gmail.com,"Sugita, Yuji/L-6726-2014","Sugita, Yuji/0000-0001-9738-9216","JST CRESTJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); RIKEN;  [26119006]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26119006] Funding Source: KAKEN","Financial support was provided in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Area Novel measurement techniques for visualizing live protein molecules at work (No. 26119006) (to Y.S.), a grant from JST CREST on Structural Life Science and Advanced Core Technologies for Innovative Life Science Research (to Y.S.), RIKEN pioneering project (dynamic structural biology).",,86,29,29,2,33,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

These experimental distributions have been converted into isoenergy contour plots using the approach employed previously by F. M. Pohl. This has led to the identification of energetically favored minima in the Ramachandran (phi, psi) plots in which global minima are predominantly observed either in the right-handed alpha-helical or the polyproline II regions. Further, we have identified low energy pathways for transitions between various minima in the (phi, psi) plots. We have compared and presented the experimental plots with published theoretical plots obtained from both molecular mechanics and quantum mechanical approaches. In addition, we have developed and employed a root mean square deviation (RMSD) metric for isoenergy contours in various ranges, as a measure (in kcal. mol 21) to compare any two plots and determine the extent of correlation and similarity between their isoenergy contours. In general, we observe a greater degree of compatibility with experimental plots for energy maps obtained from molecular mechanics methods compared to most quantum mechanical methods. The experimental energy plots we have investigated could be helpful in refining protein structures obtained from X-ray, NMR, and electron microscopy and in refining force field parameters to enable simulations of peptide and protein structures that have higher degree of consistency with experiments.

DNA binding transcription factors are major agents of transcriptional regulation, and bind to DNA with a factor-specific sequence preference to exert regulatory effects. A crucial step in unraveling the logic of a regulatory network is determining the sequence-specific binding affinity landscapes for the transcription factors in it. While such landscapes can be measured experimentally, the ability to predict them computationally would both reduce the effort required to obtain the needed data and provide additional insight into the key interactions shaping protein DNA interactions. Here we apply free energy calculations based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to predict the changes in binding free energy for all single base pair perturbations of the binding sites for four eukaryotic transcription factors for which high-quality experimental data exist. We find that the simulated results both vastly overestimate the magnitude of changes in binding free energy, and frequently predict the incorrect signs. These simulations will nevertheless serve as a jumping-off point for refining our current representation of protein DNA interactions to allow quantitative reproduction of experimental data on such systems in the future.","[Khabiri, Morteza; Freddolino, Peter L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Freddolino, Peter L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Freddolino, PL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Biol Chem, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Freddolino, PL (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Computat Med & Bioinformat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",petefred@umich.edu,,"Khabiri, Morteza/0000-0003-3292-0111","NIH R00United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM097033]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R00GM097033, R00GM097033, K99GM097033, R00GM097033, K99GM097033] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","The authors thank all members of the Freddolino laboratory for many useful discussions, Prof. Gary Stormo for encouragement and for providing early access to a reanalysis of HT-SELEX data, and Prof. Tom Cheatham and Dr. Daniel Roe for technical assistance and advice on simulation setup.

The data is often interpreted via a two-state model based on the assumption that the end-to-end distance alone is a good reaction coordinate and the thermodynamic behavior is then ascribed to the free energy as a function of this one reaction coordinate. In this paper, we determined the free energy surface (PMF) of GB1 protein from atomistic simulations in explicit solvent under different applied forces as a function of two collective variables (the end-to-end-distance, and the fraction of native contacts rho). The calculated 2-d free energy surfaces exhibited several distinct states, or basins, mostly visible along the p coordinate. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations on the smoothed free energy surface show that the protein visits a metastable molten globule state and is thus a three state folder, not the two state folder inferred using the end-to-end distance as the sole reaction coordinate. This study lends support to recent experiments that suggest that GB1 is not a two-state folder.","[Berkovich, Ronen; Paster, Inga] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Chem Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Mondal, Jagannath] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Ctr Interdisciplinary Sci, Hyderabad, Andhra Prades, India; [Berne, B.

We demonstrate that the propensity for PatG(mac)-mediated cyclization correlates strongly with the free energy of the socalled pre-cyclization conformation (PCC), which is a fold where the cyclizing sequence C and N termini are in close proximity. This conclusion is driven by comparison of the predictions of boxed molecular dynamics (BXD) with experimental data, which have achieved an accuracy of 84%. A true blind test rather than training of the model is reported here as the in silico tool was developed before any experimental data was given, and no parameters of computations were adjusted to fit the data. The success of the blind test provides fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanism of cyclization by cyanobactin macrocyclases, suggesting that formation of PCC is the rate -determining step. PCC formation might also play a part in other processes of cyclic peptides production and on the practical side the suggested tool might become useful for finding cyclizable peptide sequences in general.","[Booth, Jonathan; Shalashilin, Dmitrii V.] Univ Leeds, Sch Chem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Alexandra-Crivac, Christina-Nicoleta; Rickaby, Kirstie A.; Nneoyiegbe, Ada F.; Umeobika, Ugochukwu; McEwan, Andrew R.; Trembleau, Laurent; Jaspars, Marcel; Houssen, Wael E.] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Chem, Marine Biodiscovery Ctr, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland; [Alexandra-Crivac, Christina-Nicoleta; McEwan, Andrew R.; Houssen, Wael E.] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Med Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Houssen, Wael E.] Mansoura Univ, Pharmacognosy Dept, Fac Pharm, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Booth, Jonathan] Croda Int Plc, Cowick Hall, Goole DN14 9AA, East Yorks, England","Shalashilin, DV (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Chem, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.; Jaspars, M; Houssen, WE (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Chem, Marine Biodiscovery Ctr, Aberdeen AB24 3UE, Scotland.; Houssen, WE (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Inst Med Sci, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.; Houssen, WE (corresponding author), Mansoura Univ, Pharmacognosy Dept, Fac Pharm, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.",m.jaspars@abdn.ac.uk; w.houssen@abdn.ac.uk; d.shalashilin@leeds.ac.uk,"Houssen, Wael/K-7926-2016","Houssen, Wael/0000-0001-9653-5111; Trembleau, Laurent/0000-0001-6376-9077; Jaspars, Marcel/0000-0002-2426-6028","EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J019240/1, EP/J001481/1]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC 339367]; Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Nigeria; AstraZenecaAstraZeneca; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/J019240/1, EP/J001481/1] Funding Source: researchfish","J.J.B. acknowledges his EPSRC support from Grants EP/J019240/1 and EP/J001481/1.

It is usually hard to define the complicated boundaries of the states in the conformational space using most of the existing methods, and they often lead to parameter-sensitive results. Here, we present a new approach, visualized Trajectory Map (vTM), to identify the metastable states and the rare interstate transitions, by considering both the conformational similarity and the temporal successiveness of conformations. The vTM is able to give a nonambiguous description of slow dynamics. The case study of a beta-hairpin peptide shows that the vTM can reveal the states and transitions from all-atom MD trajectory data even when a single observable (i.e, one-dimensional reaction coordinate) is used. We also use the vTM to refine the folding/unfolding mechanism of HP35 in explicit water by analyzing a 125 mu s all-atom MD trajectory and obtain folding/unfolding rates of about 1/mu s, which are in good agreement with the experimental values.","[Zhang, Chuanbiao; Zhou, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jin] Beijing Comp Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Zhou, X (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xzhou@ucas.ac.cn,"Yu, Jin/X-6895-2019; Zhou, Xin/AAH-1238-2020","Yu, Jin/0000-0001-8224-1374; Zhang, Chuanbiao/0000-0002-5702-7867",NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11574310],This study was supported by NSFC under Grant No.11574310.,,56,4,5,2,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,1520-5207,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

NTL9 has been widely used as a model system for experimental and computational studies of protein folding and for investigations of the unfolded state. The role of side-chain interactions in the folding of NTL9 is probed by mutational analysis. phi-values, which represent the ratio of the change in the log of the folding rate upon mutation to the change in the log of the equilibrium constant for folding, are reported for 25 point mutations and 15 double mutants. All 0 -values are small, with an average over all sites probed of only 0.19 and a largest value of 0.4. The effect of modulating unfolded-state interactions is studied by measuring phi-values in second-site mutants and under solvent conditions that perturb unfolded-state energetics in a defined way. Neither of these alterations significantly affects the distribution of 0 -values. The results, combined with those of earlier studies that probe the role of hydrogen-bond formation in folding and the burial of surface area, reveal that the transition state for folding contains extensive backbone structure and buries a significant fraction of hydrophobic surface area, but lacks well developed side-chain-side-chain interactions. The folding transition state for NTL9 does not contain a specific nucleus consisting of a few key residues; rather, it involves extensive backbone hydrogen bonding and partially formed structure delocalized over almost the entire domain. The potential generality of these observations is discussed.","[Sato, Satoshi] Nomad Biosci Co Ltd, Okayama Res Pk Incubat Ctr, Okayama, Okayama, Japan; [Cho, Jae-Hyun] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Peran, Ivan; Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Soydaner-Azeloglu, Rengin G.] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Pharmacol, New York, NY USA; [Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Grad Program Biochem & Struct Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Raleigh, Daniel P.] SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Chem, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.; Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Grad Program Biochem & Struct Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.; Raleigh, DP (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Laufer Ctr Phys & Quantitat Biol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",daniel.raleigh@stonybrook.edu,,"Cho, Jae-Hyun/0000-0002-6190-6151",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1330259],This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant MCB-1330259 to D.P.R.,,50,1,1,0,8,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0006-3495,1542-0086,,BIOPHYS J,Biophys.

Recently there has been significant interest in its role in metabolic diseases and its deficiency in LIAS expression has been linked to conditions such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neonatal-onset epilepsy, suggesting a strong inverse correlation between LIAS reduction and disease status. In this study we use a bioinformatics approach to predict its structure, which would be helpful to understanding its role. A homology model for LIAS protein was generated using X-ray crystallographic structure of Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (PDB ID: 4U0P). The predicted structure has 93% of the residues in the most favour region of Ramachandran plot. The active site of LIAS protein was mapped and docked with S-Adenosyl Methionine (SAM) using GOLD software. The LIAS SAM complex was further refined using molecular dynamics simulation within the subsite 1 and subsite 3 of the active site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a reliable homology model of LIAS protein.

For example, modeling of biological networks and cellular responses relies on the availability of information on rate coefficients. Atomically detailed simulations hold the promise of supplementing experimental data to obtain a more complete kinetic picture. However, simulations at biological time scales are challenging. Typical computer resources are insufficient to provide the ensemble of trajectories at the correct length that is required for straightforward calculations of time scales. In the last years, new technologies emerged that make atomically detailed simulations of rate coefficients possible. Instead of computing complete trajectories from reactants to products, these approaches launch a large number of short trajectories at different positions. Since the trajectories are short, they are computed trivially in parallel on modern computer architecture. The starting and termination positions of the short trajectories are chosen, following statistical mechanics theory, to enhance efficiency. These trajectories are analyzed. The analysis produces accurate estimates of time scales as long as hours. The theory of Milestoning that exploits the use of short trajectories is discussed, and several applications are described.","[Elber, Ron] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Elber, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Chem, Inst Computat Engn & Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",ron@ices.utexas.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM059796, GM111364]; Welch FoundationThe Welch Foundation [F-1896]",The research summarized in the review was supported by grants GM059796 and GM111364 from the NIH and a grant F-1896 from the Welch Foundation.

Lots of different hybrid models involving multiple different resolutions have been developed to overcome the difficulty. Here we propose a novel effective hybrid CG (hyCG) approach which mixes the fine-grained interaction and its average in CG space to form a more smoothing potential energy surface. The hyCG approximately reproduces the potential of mean force in the CG space, and multiple mixed potentials can be further combined together to form a single effective force field for achieving both high efficiency and high accuracy. We illustrate the hyCG method in Trp-cage and Villin headpiece proteins to exhibit the folding of proteins. The topology of the folding landscape and thus the folding paths are preserved, while the folding is boosted nearly one order of magnitude faster. It indicates that the hyCG approach could be applied as an efficient force field in proteins.","[Lu, Yukun; OuYang, ZhongCan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Theoret Phys, Key Lab Theoret Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yukun; Zhou, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhou, X (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Phys Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xzhou@ucas.ac.cn,"Zhou, Xin/AAH-1238-2020",,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB932803]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11574310, 51561145002]; Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program; Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [51561145002]","Project supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (Grant No. 2013CB932803), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11574310), and the Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program, jointly funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 51561145002).",,42,2,2,1,16,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1674-1056,1741-4199,,CHINESE PHYS B,Chin.

The TI calculations yield a root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to experimental data of 0.132 k(B)T (0.37 kJ/mol). PAC-MAC shows a RMSE of 0.151 k(B)T with a calculation speed being potentially 1.0 X 10(4) times greater than TI. OPLS-AA force field parameters are optimized using PAC-MAC based on vapor-liquid equilibrium data, instead of enthalpies of vaporization or densities. The RMSE of PAC-MAC is reduced to 0.099 k(B)T by optimizing 50 force field parameters.

It was recently demonstrated that such transitions can be well described by a reaction coordinate, Q, that represents the collective fraction of the native contacts between the protein atoms. Here we attempt to use this reaction coordinate to enhance the conformational sampling. We perform umbrella sampling simulations with biasing potentials on Q for two model proteins, Trp-Cage and BBA, using the CHARMM force field. Hamiltonian replica exchange is implemented in these simulations to further facilitate the sampling. The simulations appear to have reached satisfactory convergence, resulting in unbiased free energies as a function of Q, In addition to the native structure, multiple folded conformations are identified in the reconstructed equilibrium ensemble. Some conformations without any native contacts nonetheless have rather compact geometries and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds not present in the native structure. Whereas the enhanced sampling along Q reasonably reproduces the equilibrium conformational space, we also find that the folding of an alpha-helix in Trp-Cage is a slow degree of freedom orthogonal to Q and therefore cannot be accelerated by biasing the reaction coordinate. Overall, we conclude that whereas Q is an excellent parameter to analyze the simulations, it is not necessarily a perfect reaction coordinate for enhanced sampling, and better incorporation of other slow degrees of freedom may further improve this reaction coordinate.","[Meshkin, Hamed; Zhu, Fangqiang] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Phys, 402 North Blackford St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Zhu, FQ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Phys, 402 North Blackford St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",fzhu0@iupui.edu,"Meshkin, Hamed/AAR-8889-2020","Meshkin, Hamed/0000-0001-7269-4687",,,,81,9,9,3,20,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In contrast to the availability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ folding. Scope of review: We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We explain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to study unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss the potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in the folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally different from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best described by a kinetic partitioning (10) mechanism. KP is a competition between at least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different conformational ensembles. Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain experiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of long-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the free energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences to populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme complexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of the folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective variables. General significance: We reconcile available computational and experimental studies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding landscapes.

Computational protein structure prediction methods aim to fill the gap while the role of protein structure refinement is to take approximate initial template-based models and bring them closer to the true native structure. Current methods for computational structure refinement rely on molecular dynamics simulations, related sampling methods, or iterative structure optimization protocols. The best methods are able to achieve moderate degrees of refinement but consistent refinement that can reach near-experimental accuracy remains elusive. Key issues revolve around the accuracy of the energy function, the inability to reliably rank multiple models, and the use of restraints that keep sampling close to the native state but also limit the degree of possible refinement. A different aspect is the question of what exactly the target of high-resolution refinement should be as experimental structures are affected by experimental conditions and different biological questions require varying levels of accuracy. While improvement of the global protein structure is a difficult problem, high-resolution refinement methods that improve local structural quality such as favorable stereochemistry and the avoidance of atomic clashes are much more successful.

Here we demonstrate a computational approach to characterize the transition between two metastable conformations in all atom simulations. Our approach is based on the finite temperature string method, and the implementation is essentially a generalization of umbrella sampling simulations with Hamiltonian replica exchange. We represent the transition pathway by a curve in the conformational space, with the curve parameter taken as the reaction coordinate. Our approach can efficiently refine a transition pathway and compute a one-dimensional free energy as a function of the reaction coordinate. A diffusion model can then be used to calculate the forward and backward transition rates, the major kinetic quantities for the transition. We applied the approach on a local transition in the ligand-free Mhp1 transporter, between its outward-facing conformation and an intermediate conformation with the side chain of Phe305 flipped to the outside of the protein. Our simulations predict that the flipped-out position of this side chain has a free energy 6.5 kcal/mol higher than the original position in the crystal structure, and that the forward and backward transition rates are in the millisecond and submicrosecond time scales, respectively.","[Song, Hyun Deok; Zhu, Fangqiang] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Phys, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Zhu, FQ (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Phys, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",fzhu0@iupui.edu,,,"Institute for Mathematical Modeling and Computational Science, School of Science, IUPUI","This work was supported by Grants to Enhance Interdisciplinary Research and Education (GEIRE) from Institute for Mathematical Modeling and Computational Science, School of Science, IUPUI.

For alpha helical proteins, the accuracy of structure prediction using AAWSEM has been established previously. In this article, we examine the capability of AAWSEM to predict the structure of alpha/beta proteins. We also elaborate on an iterative approach that uses the structures from a first round of AAWSEM simulation as fragment memories. This iterative scheme improves the quality of the structure predietion and makes the free energy profile more funneled toward native configurations. We explore the use of clustering,analyses as a way of evaluating the confidence in various structure prediction models. Clustering using a local relative order parameter (mutual Q) of the predicted structural ensemble turns out to be optimal. The tightest cluster according to mutual Q generally has the most correctly folded structure. Since there is no bioinformatic input, AAWSEM amounts to an ab initio protein structure prediction method, that combines the efficiency of coarse-grained simulations with the local structural accuracy that can be achieved from all-atom simulations.","[Chen, Mingchen; Lin, Xingcheng; Lu, Wei; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Mingchen] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng; Lu, Wei; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Biosci, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",pwolynes@rice.edu,"Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174; Chen, Mingchen/0000-0003-3916-7871","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [ROl GM44557]; Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - NSF [PHY-1427654, CHE-1614101]; D.R.

Here we leverage explicit-solvent molecular simulation and multidimensional free energy calculations to investigate how adsorption to carbon nanomaterial surfaces, affects the conformational equilibrium of alanine dipeptide, a widely used model of protein backbone structure. We find that the two most favorable structures of alanine dipeptide on graphene (or large carbon nanotubes) correspond to the two amide linkages lying in the same plane, flat against the surface, rather than the nonplanar alpha-helix-like and beta-sheet-like conformations that predominate in aqueous solution. On graphenic surfaces, the latter conformations are metastable and most Often correspond to amide-pi stacking of the N-terminal amide. The calculations highlight the key role of amide-pi interactions in determining the conformational equilibrium. Lesser but significant contributions from hydrogen bonding to the high density interfacial water layer or to the hydroxy groups of hydroxylated graphene also define the most favorable conformations.

Through the analyses of trajectories, these mini-proteins had multiple folding pathways different from a simple two-state folding, and the multiple folding processes were initiated by partial formations of secondary structures. These findings can be used to understand the folding of large proteins, that is, which secondary structures are partially folded in the early process, and how the remaining parts are sequentially folded. It is found that FSD-EY (alpha/beta topology) folds by a simple diffusion-collision mechanism, while the folding process of the FBPWW28 domain (all-beta topology) requires a modification of the diffusion-collision theory to adequately treat the coil-sheet transition for the beta sheet formation.

As an example, we investigate an isolated monomeric Myc oncoprotein that has been implicated in carcinomas including those in colon, breast, and lungs. Under physiological conditions a monomeric Myc is presumed to be an example of intrinsically disordered proteins that pose a serious challenge to existing modeling techniques. We argue that a room-temperature monomeric Myc is in a dynamical state, it oscillates between different conformations that we identify. For this we adopt the C alpha backbone of Myc in a crystallographic heteromer as an initial ansatz for the monomeric structure. We construct a multisoliton of the pertinent Landau free energy to describe the C alpha profile with ultrahigh precision. We use Glauber dynamics to resolve how the multisoliton responds to repeated increases and decreases in ambient temperature. We confirm that the initial structure is unstable in isolation. We reveal a highly degenerate ground-state landscape, an attractive set towards which Glauber dynamics converges in the limit of vanishing ambient temperature. We analyze the thermal stability of this Glauber attractor using room-temperature molecular dynamics. We identify and scrutinize a particularly stable subset in which the two helical segments of the original multisoliton align in parallel next to each other. During the MD time evolution of a representative structure from this subset, we observe intermittent quasiparticle oscillations along the C-terminal alpha helix, some of which resemble a translating Davydov's Amide-I soliton. We propose that the presence of oscillatory motion is in line with the expected intrinsically disordered character of Myc.","[Liu, Jiaojiao; Dai, Jin; He, Jianfeng; Niemi, Antti J.] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Niemi, Antti J.] Stockholm Univ, Nordita, Roslagstullsbacken 23, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Niemi, Antti J.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, POB 803, S-75108 Uppsala, Sweden; [Niemi, Antti J.] Univ Tours, Federat Denis Poisson, Lab Math & Phys Theor, CNRS,UMR 6083, Parc Grandmt, F-37200 Tours, France; [Niemi, Antti J.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Sch Biomed, Phys Living Matter, Vladivostok 690950, Russia; [Ilieva, Nevena] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Informat & Commun Technol, 25A Acad G Bonchev Str, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria","Liu, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Phys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",ljjhappy1207@163.com; daijing491@gmail.com; hjf@bit.edu.cn; Antti.Niemi@physics.uu.se; nilieval@mail.cern.ch,"Ilieva, Nevena/G-1698-2019","Ilieva, Nevena/0000-0002-2372-2319",Bulgarian Science FundNational Science Fund of Bulgaria [DNTS-CN 01/9/2014]; China-Bulgaria Intergovernmental S& T Cooperation Project at Ministry of Science and Technology of P.

In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are extremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and long-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these short simulations are in local equilibrium within the MSM states. However, over the last 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially discussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can be detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM estimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these issues: We systematically analyze the estimation of MSMs from short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the error between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from many short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained even from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag times and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model (OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that corrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag times are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate the exact eigenvalues or relaxation time scales of the system without estimating an MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the discretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular dynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration. The improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA of version 2.3.

Among the proteins of the Ebola virus, the matrix protein (VP40) plays a significant role in the virus lifecycle thereby making it a promising therapeutic target. Of interest is the newly elucidated N-terminal domain loop region of VP40 comprising residues K127, T129, and N130 which when mutated to alanine have demonstrated an unrecognized role for N-terminal domain-plasma membrane interaction for efficient VP40-plasma membrane localization, oligomerization, matrix assembly, and egress. The molecular understanding of the conformational features of VP40 in complex with a known inhibitor still remains elusive. Using accelerated molecular dynamics approaches, we conducted a comparative study on VP40 apo and bound systems to understand the conformational features of VP40 at the molecular level and to determine the effect of inhibitor binding with the aid of a number of post-dynamic analytical tools. Significant features were seen in the presence of an inhibitor as per molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area binding free energy calculations. Results revealed that inhibitor binding to VP40 reduces the flexibility and mobility of the protein as supported by root mean square fluctuation and root mean square deviation calculations. The study revealed a characteristic  twisting motion and coiling of the loop region of VP40 accompanied by conformational changes in the dimer interface upon inhibitor binding. We believe that results presented in this study will ultimately provide useful insight into the binding landscape of VP40 which could assist researchers in the discovery of potent Ebola virus inhibitors for anti-Ebola therapies.","[Balmith, Marissa; Soliman, Mahmoud E.

In this work, a partitioned integrated-tempering-sampling (P-ITS) method is proposed which takes advantage of the benefits of both parallel and integrated tempering approaches. Using P-ITS, the folding pathways of a series of proteins with diverse native structures are explored on multidimensional free-energy landscapes, and the associated thermodynamics are evaluated. In comparison to the original form of ITS, P-ITS improves the sampling efficiency and measures the folding/unfolding thermodynamic quantities more consistently with experimental data. In comparison to REMD, P-ITS significantly reduces the requirement of computational resources and meanwhile achieves similar simulation results. The observed structural characterizations of transition and intermediate states of the proteins under study are in good agreement with previous experimental and simulation studies on the same proteins and homologues. Therefore, the P-ITS method has great potential in simulating the structural dynamics of complex biomolecular systems.","[Shao, Qiang; Zhu, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jiye] UCB Biopharma SPRL, Chemin Foriest, B-1420 Braine Lalleud, Belgium","Shao, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Drug Discovery & Design Ctr, CAS Key Lab Receptor Res, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, 555 Zuchongzhi Rd, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.; Shi, JY (corresponding author), UCB Biopharma SPRL, Chemin Foriest, B-1420 Braine Lalleud, Belgium.",qshao@mail.shcnc.ac.cn; Jiye.Shi@ucb.com,"Shao, Qiang/O-4528-2019","Shao, Qiang/0000-0001-6460-3095",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21373258]; National Basic Research ProgramNational Basic Research Program of China [2014CB910400]; Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund,"We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21373258), National Basic Research Program (Grant No. 2014CB910400), and Special Program for Applied Research on Super Computation of the NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund (the second phase) for financial support.

In SDS, initial structures are selected based on structural dissimilarity, and conformational resampling is repeated. Conformational resampling is performed as follows: (I) arrangement of initial structures for a diverse distribution at the edge of a conformational subspace and (II) promotion of the structural transitions with multiple short time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations restarting from the diversely distributed initial structures. Cycles of (I) and (II) are repeated to intensively promote structural transitions because conformational resampling from the initial structures would quickly expand conformational distributions toward unvisited conformational subspaces. As a demonstration, SDS was first applied to maltodextrin binding protein (MBP) in explicit water to reproduce structural transitions between the open and closed states of MBP. Structural transitions of MBP were successfully reproduced with SDS in nanosecond-order simulation times. Starting from both the open and closed forms, SDS successfully reproduced the structural transitions within 25 cycles (a total of 250 ns of simulation time). For reference, a conventional long-time (500 ns) MD simulation under NPT (300 K and 1 bar) starting from the open form failed to reproduce the structural transition. In addition to the open closed motions of MBP, SDS was applied to folding processes of the fast-folding proteins (chignolin, Trp-cage, and villin) and successfully sampled their native states. To confirm how the selections of initial structures affected conformational sampling efficiency, numbers of base sets for characterizing structural dissimilarity of initial structures were addressed in distinct trials of SDS. The parameter searches showed that the conformational sampling efficiency was relatively insensitive with respect to the numbers of base sets, indicating the robustness of SDS for actual applications.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, Tennodai 1-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J03797]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H06164]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26102525, 26107004, 26105012]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15J03797, 16H06164, 26107004] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientist (No. 15J03797) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (No. 16H06164) and by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Dynamic Ordering and Biofunction, Photosynergetics, and 3D Active-Site Science (Nos. 26102525, 26107004, and 26105012) from JSPS.",,63,16,16,0,14,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

When they work properly, they are able to provide invaluable interpretations of experimental results and ultimately provide novel, experimentally testable predictions. Unfortunately, not all simulation models are created equal, and with inaccurate models it becomes unclear what is a bona fide prediction versus a simulation artifact. RNA models are still in their infancy compared to the many robust protein models that are widely in use, and for that reason the number of RNA force field revisions in recent years has been rapidly increasing. As there is no universally accepted 'best' RNA force field at the current time, RNA simulators must decide which one is most suited to their purposes, cognizant of its essential assumptions and their inherent strengths and weaknesses. Hopefully, armed with a better understanding of what goes inside the simulation 'black box,' RNA biochemists can devise novel experiments and provide crucial thermodynamic and structural data that will guide the development and testing of improved RNA models.

Interactions between protein residues and solvent molecules are of great importance for proteins to maintain their active structure and catalyze biochemical reactions. In this study, we investigated such interactions and studied the structural transitions of proteins during their dissolution process. Our previously developed technique, namely solvent assisted electric field induced desorption/ionization, was used for the dissolution and immediate ionization of proteins. Different solvents and proteins were involved in the investigation. According to the results, cytochrome c underwent significant unfolding during dissolution in the most commonly used NH4Ac buffer. The unfolding got more serious when the concentration of NH4Ac was further increased. Extending the dissolution time resulted in the re-folding of cytochrome c. In comparison, no unfolding was observed if cytochrome c was pre-dissolved in NH4Ac buffer and detected by nano-ESI. Furthermore, no unfolding was observed during the dissolution process of cytochrome c in water. Interactions between the residues of cytochrome c and the solute of NH4Ac might be the reason for the unfolding phenomenon. Similar unfolding phenomenon was observed on holo-myoglobin. However, the observed dissolution feature of insulin was different. No unfolding was observed on insulin during dissolution in NH4Ac buffers. Insulin underwent observable unfolding when water was used for dissolution. This might be due to the structural difference between different proteins. The obtained results in the present study furthered our insights into the interactions between proteins and the solvents during the phase transition of dissolution.","[Gong, Xiaoyun; Xiong, Xingchuang; Qi, Lin; Fang, Xiang] Natl Inst Metrol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Fang, X (corresponding author), Natl Inst Metrol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST)Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2011YQ090005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [2011YQ09000501, 2011YQ09000507]","This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST, No. 2011YQ090005) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Nos. 2011YQ09000501 and 2011YQ09000507).

We ask by how much the MD sampling quality for flexible molecules can be improved by two means: the use of diverse sets of trajectories starting from different initial conformations to detect deviations between samples and sampling with enhanced methods such as accelerated MD (aMD) or scaled MD (sMD) that distort the energy landscape in controlled ways. To this end, we test the effects of these approaches on MD simulations of two flexible biomolecules in aqueous solution, Met-Enkephalin (5 amino acids) and HIV-1 gp120 V3 (a cycle of 35 amino acids). We assess the convergence of the sampling quantitatively with known, extensive measures of cluster number N-c and cluster distribution entropy S-c and with two new quantities, conformational overlap O-conf and density overlap O-dens, both conveniently ranging from 0 to 1. These new overlap measures quantify self-consistency of sampling in multitrajectory MD experiments, a necessary condition for converged sampling. A comprehensive assessment of sampling quality of MD experiments identifies the combination of diverse trajectory sets and aMD as the most efficient approach among those tested. However, analysis of O-dens between conventional and aMD trajectories also reveals that we have not completely corrected aMD sampling for the distorted energy landscape. Moreover, for V3, the courses of N-c, and O-dens indicate that much higher resources than those generally invested today will probably be needed to achieve convergence. The comparative analysis also shows that conventional MD simulations with insufficient sampling can be easily misinterpreted as being converged.","[Nemec, Mike; Hoffmann, Daniel] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Med Biotechnol, Bioinformat & Computat Biophys, D-45117 Essen, Germany","Hoffmann, D (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Med Biotechnol, Bioinformat & Computat Biophys, D-45117 Essen, Germany.",daniel.hoffinann@uni-due.de,"Hoffmann, Daniel/P-5624-2019; Hoffmann, Daniel/B-1314-2018","Hoffmann, Daniel/0000-0003-2973-7869; Hoffmann, Daniel/0000-0003-2973-7869",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 1093/A7],The authors thank Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for funding through Grant CRC 1093/A7.,,64,6,6,0,18,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

The decoration with surfactants has a long history and is essential to introduce specific functions. The definition of surfactants in this review is very broad, following its lexical meaning surface active agents, and therefore includes traditional alkyl modifiers, biological ligands, polymers, and other surface active molecules. The review systematically covers covalent and non-covalent interactions of such surfactants with various types of nanomaterials, including metals, oxides, layered materials, and polymers as well as their applications. The major themes are (i) molecular recognition and noncovalent assembly mechanisms of surfactants on the nanoparticle and nanocrystal surfaces, (ii) covalent grafting techniques and multi-step surface modification, (iii) dispersion properties and surface reactions, (iv) the use of surfactants to influence crystal growth, as well as (v) the incorporation of biorecognition and other material-targeting functionality. For the diverse materials classes, similarities and differences in surfactant assembly, function, as well as materials performance in specific applications are described in a comparative way. Major factors that lead to differentiation are the surface energy, surface chemistry and pH sensitivity, as well as the degree of surface regularity and defects in the nanoparticle cores and in the surfactant shell. The review covers a broad range of surface modifications and applications in biological recognition and therapeutics, sensors, nanomaterials for catalysis, energy conversion and storage, the dispersion properties of nanoparticles in structural composites and cement, as well as purification systems and classical detergents. Design principles for surfactants to optimize the performance of specific nanostructures are discussed. The review concludes with challenges and opportunities. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Their high degree of disorder makes them more challenging to study using the techniques of conventional structural biology, because any observable will be averaged over a heterogeneous ensemble of structures. Molecular simulations and theory are therefore a natural complement to experiment for studying the structure, dynamics and function of IDPs. The diverse time and length scales relevant to the roles played by IDPs require flexibility in the techniques applied. Here, I summarize some of the developments in simulation and theory in recent years, which have been driven by the desire to better capture IDP properties at different time- and length-scales. I also provide an outlook for how methods can be improved in the future and emerging problems which may be addressed by theory and simulation.","[Best, Robert B.] NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Best, RB (corresponding author), NIDDK, Chem Phys Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.",robertbe@helix.nih.gov,,,"Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIA DK075104-04]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104, ZIADK075104] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, via Intramural Award ZIA DK075104-04.",,73,75,76,3,66,CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0959-440X,1879-033X,,CURR OPIN STRUC BIOL,Curr.

We introduce a definition of the natural reaction coordinate, suitable for condensed phase and biomolecular systems, as a maximally predictive one-dimensional projection. We then show that this criterion is uniquely satisfied by a dominant eigenfunction of an integral operator associated with the ensemble dynamics. We present a new sparse estimator for these eigenfunctions which can search through a large candidate pool of structural order parameters and build simple, interpretable approximations that employ only a small number of these order parameters. Example applications with a small molecule's rotational dynamics and simulations of protein conformational change and folding show that this approach can filter through statistical noise to identify simple reaction coordinates from complex dynamics.

Like the previous accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD), GaMD allows for unconstrained enhanced sampling without the need to set predefined collective variables and so is useful for studying complex biomolecular conformational changes such as protein folding and ligand binding. Furthermore, because the boost potential is constructed using a harmonic function that follows Gaussian distribution in GaMD, cumulant expansion to the second order can be applied to recover the original free energy profiles of proteins and other large biomolecules, which solves a long-standing energetic reweighting problem of the previous aMD method. Taken together, GaMD offers major advantages for both unconstrained enhanced sampling and free energy calculations of large biomolecules. Here, we have implemented GaMD in the NAMD package on top of the existing aMD feature and validated it on three model systems: alanine dipeptide, the chignolin fast-folding protein, and the M-3 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). For alanine dipeptide, while conventional molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations performed for 30 ns are poorly converged, GaMD simulations of the same length yield free energy profiles that agree quantitatively with those of 1000 ns cMD simulation. Further GaMD simulations have captured folding of the chignolin and binding of the acetylcholine (ACh) endogenous agonist to the M3 muscarinic receptor. The reweighted free energy profiles are used to characterize the protein folding and ligand binding pathways quantitatively.

Very often the sampling is severely limited by complexity of the phase space, possibly leading to poorly converged or inaccurate free energy profiles. We explored the factors governing the completeness of reaction path sampling for the rate limiting step of phenylethylamine oxidation by lumiflavin in the gas phase, a reaction important for the pharmacology of the central nervous system. The simulations utilize the free energy perturbation sampling technique together with the empirical valence bond methodology for the free energy calculations. The simplicity of the system allows for the acquisition of fully converged free energy profiles, even for simulation free of restraints. The bottleneck for convergence is in the noticeably poorer sampling statistics in the transition state region, which is resolved by performing sufficiently long simulation to ensure reversibility of all processes accompanying the reaction. In the present case, convergence is attained in microseconds of simulation, but the required simulation time generally depends on the complexity of the potential energy surface pertinent to the reaction. Accordingly, the use of restraints reduces the complexity of the phase space, decreasing the required time by about an order of magnitude. In the case of elementary nucleophilic substitution with even simpler potential energy surface convergence is reached already at a timescale of few nanoseconds. For related biomolecular reactions embedded in an enzyme, significantly longer simulation times may be needed, rendering the sampling problem exceedingly difficult and representing a challenge for advanced sampling techniques. Accordingly, suggestions are given for optimal simulation of biomolecular reactions based on the presently employed techniques and under the aforementioned limitations.","[Stare, Jernej] Natl Inst Chem, Dept Computat Biochem & Drug Design, Hajdrihova 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Stare, J (corresponding author), Natl Inst Chem, Dept Computat Biochem & Drug Design, Hajdrihova 19, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.",jernej.stare@ki.si,,"Stare, Jernej/0000-0002-2018-6688",Slovenian Research AgencySlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [P1-0012],"The author is thankful to Janez Mavri for stimulating discussions and critical comments.

Short peptides are typically used as models to study the formation of specific structures. However, while the formation of alpha-helical structure was investigated thoroughly, until recently, there have been much fewer studies on the formation of beta-structure. In this review, recent experimental and theoretical studies of beta-hairpin-forming peptides, both model alaninebased systems, and those based on the fragments of real proteins, are summarized with regard to the role of hydrophobic, local, and Coulombic interactions. It is demonstrated that the presence of charged residues can induce a bent structure not only owing to the formation of salt bridges if oppositely-charged residues present at the ends of a sequence but also through shielding the hydrophobic interior by like-charged residues at the end of the sequence.","[Makowska, Joanna] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland","Makowska, J (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",joanna.makowska@ug.edu.pl,,,,,,64,0,0,1,5,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1389-2037,1875-5550,,CURR PROTEIN PEPT SC,Curr.

The latter phenomenon typically leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils that are linked to several lethal neurodegenerative diseases, but that can also play a functional role in certain organisms. The majority of molecular simulations performed before the last few years were conducted in diluted solutions and were restricted both in the timescales and in the system dimensions by the available computational resources. In recent years, several computational solutions were developed to get close to physiological conditions.

The azole antifungal drugs inhibit the ergosterol synthesis by targeting lanosterol 14-demethylase of cytochrome P450 family. The lack of high-resolution structural information of fungal pathogens has been a barrier for the design of modified azole drugs. Thus, a preliminary theoretical molecular dynamic study is carried out to develop and validate a simple homologous model using crystallographic structure of the lanosterol 14-demethylase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB ID-1EA1) in which the active site residues are substituted with that of C. albicans (taxid 5476). Further, novel designed pyrazole analogs (SGS1-16) docked on chimeric 1EA1 and revealed that SGS-16 show good binding affinity through non-bonding interaction with the heme, which is different from the leading azole antifungals. The ADME-T results showed these analogs can be further explored in design of more safe and effective antifungal agents.","[Jacob, Sony K.; Ganguly, Swastika; Kumar, Anoop] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India; [Kumar, Pravin; Poddar, Raju] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Bioengn, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India","Jacob, KS (corresponding author), Birla Inst Technol, Dept Pharmaceut Sci & Technol, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India.",sonyivin@gmail.com,"Ganguly, Swastika/L-9579-2017; Kumar, Anoop/A-3723-2016","Ganguly, Swastika/0000-0001-5042-0773; Kumar, Anoop/0000-0002-7806-9986","University Grants Commission (UGC)University Grants Commission, India [MANF-2012-13-CHR-KER-13883]",The authors acknowledge University Grants Commission (UGC) for financial support in the form of Maulana Azad fellowship [grant number MANF-2012-13-CHR-KER-13883].,,46,21,22,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0739-1102,1538-0254,,J BIOMOL STRUCT DYN,J.

We present a generally applicable method to study dehydration of hydrates based on MD simulations and apply this approach to the dehydration of ampicillin trihydrate. The crystallographic unit cell of the trihydrate is used to construct the simulation cell containing 216 ampicillin and 648 water molecules. This system is dehydrated by removing water molecules during a 2200 ps simulation, and depending on the computational dehydration rate, different dehydrated structures were observed. Removing all water molecules immediately and removing water relatively fast (10 water molecules/10 ps) resulted in an amorphous system, whereas relatively slow computational dehydration (3 water molecules/10 ps) resulted in a crystalline anhydrate. The structural changes could be followed in real time, and in addition, an intermediate amorphous phase was identified. The computationally identified dehydrated structure (anhydrate) was slightly different from the experimentally known anhydrate structure suggesting that the simulated computational structure could represent a kinetically trapped dehydration intermediate.

Protein structure is constantly fluctuating and undergoing conformational changes, which are captured by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We introduce a computational framework that provides a compact representation of the dynamic conformational space of biomolecular simulations. This method presents a systematic approach designed to reduce the large MD simulation spatiotemporal datasets into a manageable set in order to guide our understanding of how protein mechanics emerge from side chain organization and dynamic reorganization. We focus on the detection of side chain interactions that undergo rearrangements mediating global domain motions and vice versa. Side chain rearrangements are extracted from side chain interactions that undergo well-defined abrupt and persistent changes in distance time series using Gaussian mixture models, whereas global domain motions are detected using dynamic cross-correlation. Both side chain rearrangements and global domain motions represent the dynamic components of the protein MD simulation, and are both mapped into a network where they are connected based on their degree of coupling. This method allows for the study of allosteric communication in proteins by mapping out the protein dynamics into an intramolecular network to reduce the large simulation data into a manageable set of communities composed of coupled side chain rearrangements and global domain motions. This computational framework is suitable for the study of tightly packed proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors, and we present an application on a seven microseconds MD trajectory of CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) bound to its ligand CCL21.

Such SMFS studies and, more generally, the diverse applications of AFM across biophysics and nanotechnology are improved by enhancing data quality via improved force stability, force precision, and temporal resolution. For an advanced, small-format commercial AFM, we illustrate how these three metrics are limited by the cantilever itself rather than the larger microscope structure, and then describe three increasingly sophisticated cantilever modifications that yield enhanced data quality. First, sub-pN force precision and stability over a broad bandwidth (Delta f = 0.01-20 Hz) is routinely achieved by removing a long (L = 100 mu m) cantilever's gold coating. Next, this sub-pN bandwidth is extended by a factor of similar to 50 to span five decades of bandwidth (Delta f = 0.01-1000 Hz) by using a focused ion beam (FIB) to modify a shorter (L = 40 mu m) cantilever. Finally, FIB-modifying an ultrashort (L = 9 mu m) cantilever improves its force stability and precision while maintaining 1-mu s temporal resolution. These modified ultrashort cantilevers have a reduced quality factor Q approximate to 0.5) and therefore do not apply a substantial (30-90 pN), high-frequency force modulation to the molecule, a phenomenon that is unaccounted for in traditional SMFS analysis. Currently, there is no perfect cantilever for all applications. Optimizing AFM-based SMFS requires understanding the tradeoffs inherent to using a specific cantilever and choosing the one best suited to a particular application.

In this work, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate both the folded and unfolded states of 4E-BP2 under different phosphorylation states of T37 and T46. The results show that the phosphorylated forms of both T37 and T46 play important roles in stabilizing the folded structure, especially for the beta-turns and the sequestered binding motif. The phosphorylated residues not only guide the folding of the protein through several intermediate states but also affect the conformational distribution of the unfolded ensemble. Significantly, the phosphorylated residues can function as nucleation sites for the folding of the protein by forming certain local structures that are stabilized by hydrogen bonding involving the phosphate group. The region around phosphorylated T46 appears to fold before that around phosphorylated T37. These findings provide new insight into the intricate effects of protein phosphorylation.","[Zeng, Juan; Jiang, Fan; Wu, Yun-Doug] Peking Univ, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yun-Doug] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Jiang, F; Wu, YD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Wu, YD (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jiangfan@pku.edu.cn; wuyd@pkusz.edu.cn,"Wu, Yun-Dong/G-8463-2013",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21133002, 21573009, 21603006]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee [KQTD 201103, JCYJ20140509093817689, JCYJ20140509093817686]; Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School","We thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support (grant nos. 21133002 to Y.-D.W., 21573009 to F.J., and 21603006 to J.Z.).

The high-dimensional spaces considered in that work were the set of backbone dihedral angles of a small peptide, Chignolin, and the high-dimensional free energy surface was approximated as the sum of many two-dimensional terms plus an additional term which represents an initial estimate. In this paper, we build on that work and demonstrate that we can calculate high-dimensional free energy surfaces of very high accuracy by incorporating additional terms. The additional terms apply to a set of collective variables which are more coarse than the base set of collective variables. In this way, it is possible to build hierarchical free energy surfaces, which are composed of terms that act on different length scales. We test the accuracy of these free energy landscapes for the proteins Chignolin and Trp-cage by constructing simple coarse-grained models and comparing results from the coarse grained model to results from atomistic simulations. The approach described in this paper is ideally suited for problems in which the free energy surface has important features on different length scales or in which there is some natural hierarchy.","[Shaffer, Patrick; Valsson, Omar; Parrinello, Michele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shaffer, Patrick; Valsson, Omar; Parrinello, Michele] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Sci Computazionali, Fac Informat, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Valsson, Omar; Parrinello, Michele] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Natl Ctr Computat Design & Discovery Novel Mat MA, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland","Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.; Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Sci Computazionali, Fac Informat, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.; Parrinello, M (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Natl Ctr Computat Design & Discovery Novel Mat MA, Via Giuseppe Buffi 13, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.",parrinello@phys.chem.ethz.ch,"Valsson, Omar/D-2438-2010","Valsson, Omar/0000-0001-7971-4767",Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) [s638]; NCCR MARVEL - Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF); European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [ERC-2014-AdG-670227/VARMET],"This work was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) under project ID s638.

However, the standard GB becomes prohibitively expensive for all-atom simulations of large structures; the model scales poorly, similar to n(2), with the number of solute atoms. Here we combine our recently developed optimal point charge approximation (OPCA) with the hierarchical charge partitioning (HCP) approximation to present an similar to n log n multiscale, yet fully atomistic, GB model (GB-HCPO). The HCP approximation exploits the natural organization of biomolecules (atoms, groups, chains, and complexes) to partition the structure into multiple hierarchical levels of components. OPCA approximates the charge distribution for each of these components by a small number of point charges so that the low order multipole moments of these components are optimally reproduced. The approximate charges are then used for computing electrostatic interactions with distant components, while the full set of atomic charges are used for nearby components. We show that GB-HCPO can deliver up to 2 orders of magnitude speedup compared to the standard GB, with minimal impact on its accuracy. For large structures, GB-HCPO can approach the same nominal speed, as in nanoseconds per day, as the highly optimized explicit-solvent simulation based on particle mesh Ewald (PME). The increase in the nominal simulation speed, relative to the standard GB, coupled with substantially faster sampling of conformational space, relative to the explicit solvent, makes GB-HCPO a suitable candidate for MD simulation of large atomistic systems in implicit solvent. As a practical demonstration, we use GB-HCPO simulation to refine a similar to 1.16 million atom structure of 30 nm chromatin fiber (40 nucleosomes). The refined structure suggests important details about spatial organization of the linker DNA and the histone tails in the fiber: (1) the linker DNA fills the core region, allowing the H3 histone tails to interact with the linker DNA, which is consistent with experiment; (2) H3 and H4 tails are found mostly in the core of the structure, closer to the helical axis of the fiber, while H2A and H2B are mostly solvent exposed. Potential functional consequences of these findings are discussed. GB-HCPO is implemented in the open source MD software NAB in Amber 2016.","[Izadi, Saeed] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biomed Engn & Mech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Anandakrishnan, Ramu] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Edward Via Coll Osteopath Med, Div Biomed, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Onufriev, Alexey V.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA","Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.; Onufriev, AV (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Ctr Soft Matter & Biol Phys, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",alexey@cs.vt.edu,"Anandakrishnan, Ramu/AAB-9040-2020","Anandakrishnan, Ramu/0000-0003-0422-3984; Onufriev, Alexey/0000-0002-4930-6612","NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM076121]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM076121, R01GM099450, R01GM076121, R01GM099450, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM099450, R01GM076121, R01GM076121, R01GM099450, R01GM076121, R01GM076121] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",This work was supported by the NIH GM076121.,,116,12,12,1,12,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In general, the melting transition, as well as the precise sequence of folding events, is accurately reproduced with conservative local rigidification. However, aggressive rigidification leads to increased topological frustration and a concomitant slowing down of the global kinetics.

The tensorial elastic network model, which relies on the native state topology of a protein, combines the anisotropic network model, the bond bending elasticity, and the backbone twist elasticity to successfully predicts both the isotropic and anisotropic fluctuations in a manner similar to the Gaussian network model and anisotropic network model. The unfolding process is modeled by breaking the native contacts between residues one by one, and by assuming a threshold value for strain fluctuation. Using this method, we simulated the unfolding processes of four well-characterized proteins: chymotrypsin inhibitor, barnase, ubiquitein, and adenalyate kinase. We found that this step-wise process leads to two or more cooperative, first-order-like transitions between partial denaturation states. The sequence of unfolding events obtained using this method is consistent with experimental and MD studies. The results also imply that the native topology of proteins encrypts information regarding their unfolding process. Proteins 2016; 84:1767-1775.

The dynamics is then described in a simple and intuitive way as diffusion on the associated free-energy profile. In order to use such a picture for a quantitative description of the dynamics one needs to select the coordinate in an optimal way so as to minimize non-Markovian effects due to the projection. For equilibrium dynamics between two boundary states (e.g., a reaction), the optimal coordinate is known as the committor or the pfold coordinate in protein folding studies. While the dynamics projected on the committor is not Markovian, many important quantities of the original multidimensional dynamics on an arbitrarily complex landscape can be computed exactly. In this study, we summarize the derivation of this result, discuss different approaches to determine and validate the committor coordinate, and present three illustrative applications: protein folding, the game of chess, and patient recovery dynamics after kidney transplant.

While the large conformational changes, such as folding and functioning, are slow and appear to occur in a highly cooperative manner, how the hierarchical dynamics over different time scales play a role during these slow transitions has been of great interest over the decades. Here we study the folding mechanism of the villin headpiece subdomain (HP35) to understand the molecular mechanism behind this prototypical fast-folding protein. The similar to 400 mu s molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories obtained by Piana et al. [Piana, S.; Lindorff-Larsen, K.; Shaw, D. E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012, 109, 17845] are analyzed in detail. By extracting the slowest mode from the trajectories, which is responsible for the folding/unfolding transitions, and by analyzing the transition events along this mode, we find that the transitions occur in a heterogeneous manner. Detailed analysis of the individual transition events shows that the folding/unfolding transitions occur via two qualitatively different pathways, i.e., the unfolding triggered from the C-terminal (alpha(3) helix) and from the N-terminal (alpha(1)-alpha(2) loop). Non-native contacts are also found to contribute in slowing down the transitions. The folding of HP35 thus proceeds in a segmental manner rather than cooperatively at the submicrosecond time scale. The Lys -> Nle mutation is found to speed up the transitions by rigidifying the alpha(3) helix, i.e., suppressing one transition pathway. The analysis of the microsecond dynamics in the single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer efficiency trajectories, which are calculated from the MD data, reveals that the folding/unfolding transitions in the NleNle mutant can be fitted with a two-state model, whereas those in WT appear to be more complex and involves multiple time scales. This is due to the coupling between the folding/unfolding transitions and conformational transitions within the unfolded and. intermediate states. The present study demonstrates that a protein as small as HP35 already involves heterogeneous characters during folding/unfolding transitions when the hierarchical dynamics at the molecular level is considered, thus heterogeneity can be a general characteristic in protein folding.","[Mori, Toshifumi; Saito, Shinji] Inst Mol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Phys Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Mori, T; Saito, S (corresponding author), Inst Mol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.",mori@ims.ac.jp; shinji@ims.ac.jp,"Saito, Shinji/B-9746-2019","Saito, Shinji/0000-0003-4982-4820; Mori, Toshifumi/0000-0003-0188-0794","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP15K17813, JP16H00856, JP16H02254]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16H00856, 16H02254, 15K17813] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to D.E.

For this reason, the development of alternative structural tools for probing IDP ensembles has attracted considerable attention. Here we describe our recent work in developing experimental, and computational tools for characterizing IDP ensembles using Amide I (backbone carbonyl stretch) vibrational spectroscopy. In this approach, the infrared (IR) absorption frequencies of isotope-labeled amide bonds probe their local electrostatic environments and structures. Empirical frequency maps allow us to use this spectroscopic data as a direct experimental test of atomistic structural models. We apply these methods to a family of short elastin-like peptides (ELPs), fragments of the elastin protein based around the Pro-Gly turn motif characteristic of the elastomeric segments of the full protein. Using a maximum entropy analysis that applies constraints from experimental spectra to weighting predicted spectra from-molecular dynamics (MD) ensembles, we find that peptides with Ala or Val side chains preceding the Pro-Gly turn unit exhibit a stronger tendency toward extended structures than do Gly-Pro-Gly motifs, suggesting an important role for steric interactions in tuning the molecular properties of elastin.","[Reppert, Mike; Roy, Anish R.; Tempkin, Jeremy O.

However, some aspects of protein folding still need further attention. One of these is the exact relationship between the folded and unfolded states and the differences between them. Whereas the folded state is well known, at least from a structural point of view (just think of the thousands of structures in online databases), the unfolded state is more elusive. Also, these are dynamic states of matter, and this aspect cannot be overlooked. Molecular dynamics-derived correlation matrices are an invaluable source of information on the protein dynamics. Here, bulk eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrices obtained from the Trp-cage dynamics in the folded and unfolded states have been analyzed. The associated modes represent localized vibrations and are significantly affected by the fine details of the structure and interactions. Therefore, these bulk modes can be used as probes of the protein local dynamics in different states. The results of these analyses show that the correlation matrices describing the folded and unfolded dynamics belong to different symmetry classes. This finding provides new support to the phase-transition models of protein folding.","[Palese, Luigi L.] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs SMBNOS, Piazza G Cesare Policlin, I-70124 Bari, Italy","Palese, LL (corresponding author), Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Basic Med Sci Neurosci & Sense Organs SMBNOS, Piazza G Cesare Policlin, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",luigileonardo.palese@uniba.it,"Palese, Luigi Leonardo/AAB-2347-2019","Palese, Luigi Leonardo/0000-0002-3447-1535",University of Bari [CUP H93G13000170005],This work was supported by a grant from the University of Bari (CUP H93G13000170005).,,74,8,8,0,3,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1520-6106,1520-5207,,J PHYS CHEM B,J.

This process is characterized by simple two-state thermodynamics with large and compensating changes in entropy and enthalpy and a funnel-like free energy landscape with a free-energy barrier that varies linearly with temperature. One might attribute the commonality of this two-state folding behavior to features particular to these proteins (e.g., chain length, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, attributes of the native state) or one might suspect that this similarity in behavior has a more general polymer-physics origin. Here we show that this behavior is also typical for flexible homopolymer chains with sufficiently short range interactions. Two-state behavior arises from the presence of a low entropy ground (folded) state separated from a set of high entropy disordered (unfolded) states by a free energy barrier. This homopolymer model exhibits a funneled free energy landscape that reveals a complex underlying dynamics involving competition between folding and non-folding pathways. Despite the presence of multiple pathways, this simple physics model gives the robust result of two-state thermodynamics for both the cases of folding from a basin of expanded coil states and from a basin of compact globule states.

To systematically compare results across models, the scales of time, energy, and force had to be suitably renormalized in each model. Surprisingly, the HA-Go model gives the softest protein, exhibiting much smaller force peaks than all other models after the above renormalization. Clustering to render a structural taxonomy as the protein unfolds showed that the AA, HA-Go, and Ca-Go models exhibit a single pathway for early unfolding, which eventually bifurcates repeatedly to multiple branches only after the protein is about half-unfolded. The AWSEM model shows a single dominant unfolding pathway over the whole range of unfolding, in contrast to all other models. TM alignment, clustering analysis, and native contact maps show that the AWSEM pathway has however the most structural similarity to the AA model at high nativeness, but the least structural similarity to the AA model at low nativeness. In comparison to the AA model, the sequence of native contact breakage is best predicted by the HAGo model. All models consistently predict a similar unfolding mechanism for early force-induced unfolding events, but diverge in their predictions for late stage unfolding events when the protein is more significantly disordered.","[Habibi, Mona; Rottler, Jorg; Plotkin, Steven S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Plotkin, Steven S.] Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci & Technol Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Plotkin, SS (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Phys & Astron, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Plotkin, SS (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Genome Sci & Technol Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",steve@physics.ubc.ca,"Plotkin, Steven/AAO-3257-2020; Rottler, Joerg/L-5539-2013","Plotkin, Steven/0000-0001-8998-877X; Rottler, Joerg/0000-0002-5273-7480","Alberta Prion Research Institute (APRI) [PTM13007]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [2682]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [250041-2011, 327247-2011]","SSP is supported by the Alberta Prion Research Institute (APRI Research Team Program, grant #PTM13007), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR Transitional Operating Grant #2682), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC Discovery Grant #250041-2011).

We validate the CABS-membrane model in folding simulations of 10 short helical membrane proteins not using any knowledge about their structure. The simulations start from random protein conformations placed outside the membrane environment and allow for full flexibility of the modeled proteins during their spontaneous insertion into the membrane. In the resulting trajectories, we have found models close to the experimental membrane structures. We also attempted to select the correctly folded models using simple filtering followed by structural clustering combined with reconstruction to the all-atom representation and all-atom scoring.

In this approach, restrained multiplexed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with UNRES, with the C-alpha-distance and virtual-bond-dihedral angle restraints derived from knowledge-based models are carried out. In this work, we report a test of this approach in the 11th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11), in which we used the template-based models from early-stage predictions by the LEE group CASP11 server (group 038, called nns), and further improvement of the method. The quality of the models obtained in CASP11 was better than that resulting from unrestrained UNRES simulations; however, the obtained models were generally worse than the final nns models. Calculations with the final nns models, performed after CASP11, resulted in substantial improvement, especially for multi-domain proteins. Based on these results, we modified the procedure by deriving restraints from models from multiple servers, in this study the four top-performing servers in CASP11 (nns, BAKER-ROSETTASERVER, Zhang-server, and QUARK), and implementing either all restraints or only the restraints on the fragments that appear similar in the majority of models (the consensus fragments), outlier models discarded. Tests with 29 CASP11 human-prediction targets with length less than 400 amino-acid residues demonstrated that the consensus-fragment approach gave better results, i.e., lower a-carbon root-mean-square deviation from the experimental structures, higher template modeling score, and global distance test total score values than the best of the parent server models. Apart from global improvement (repacking and improving the orientation of domains and other substructures), improvement was also reached for template-based modeling targets, indicating that the approach has refinement capacity. Therefore, the consensus-fragment analysis is able to remove lower-quality models and poor-quality parts of the models without knowing the experimental structure.","[Mozolewska, Magdalena A.; Krupa, Pawel; Zaborowski, Bartlomiej; Liwo, Adam; Czaplewski, Cezary] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Liwo, Adam; Lee, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Struct, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Liwo, Adam; Lee, Jooyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea; [Joo, Keehyoung] Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Adv Computat, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea","Liwo, A (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.; Liwo, A (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Ctr Silico Prot Struct, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.; Liwo, A (corresponding author), Korea Inst Adv Study, Sch Computat Sci, 85 Hoegiro, Seoul 130722, South Korea.",adam@sunl.chem.univ.gda.pl,"Mozolewska, Magdalena/E-1895-2016; Krupa, Pawel/S-2292-2016; Czaplewski, Cezary/E-1503-2016","Mozolewska, Magdalena/0000-0001-7190-7951; Krupa, Pawel/0000-0002-9710-7837; Czaplewski, Cezary/0000-0002-0294-3403","National Science Center of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) [DEC-2013/10/M/ST4/00640]; Foundation for Polish ScienceFoundation for Polish Science [Mistrz 7./2013]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST)Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government [2008-0061987]","This work was supported by grant DEC-2013/10/M/ST4/00640 from the National Science Center of Poland (Narodowe Centrum Nauki) and grant Mistrz 7./2013 from the Foundation for Polish Science.

Our methodology involved extensive multiplexed replica exchange simulations of the target proteins with a recently improved UNRES force field to provide better reproductions of the local structures of polypeptide chains. All simulations were started from fully extended polypeptide chains, and no external information was included in the simulation process except for weak restraints on secondary structure to enable us to finish each prediction within the allowed 3-week time window. Because of simplified UNRES representation of polypeptide chains, use of enhanced sampling methods, code optimization and parallelization and sufficient computational resources, we were able to treat, for the first time, all 55 human prediction targets with sizes from 44 to 595 amino acid residues, the average size being 251 residues. Complete structures of six singledomain proteins were predicted accurately, with the highest accuracy being attained for the T0769, for which the CaRMSD was 3.8 angstrom for 97 residues of the experimental structure. Correct structures were also predicted for 13 domains of multi-domain proteins with accuracy comparable to that of the best template-based modeling methods. With further improvements of the UNRES force field that are now underway, our physics-based coarse-grained approach to protein-structure prediction will eventually reach global prediction capacity and, consequently, reliability in simulating protein structure and dynamics that are important in biochemical processes.","[Krupa, Pawel; Mozolewska, Magdalena A.; Wisniewska, Marta; Sieradzan, Adam K.; Ganzynkowicz, Robert; Lipska, Agnieszka G.; Karczynska, Agnieszka; Slusarz, Magdalena; Slusarz, Rafal; Gieldon, Artur; Czaplewski, Cezary; Jagiela, Dawid; Zaborowski, Bartlomiej; Liwo, Adam] Univ Gdansk, Fac Chem, Wita Stwosza 63, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Krupa, Pawel; Mozolewska, Magdalena A.; Wisniewska, Marta; Yin, Yanping; He, Yi; Sieradzan, Adam K.; Lipska, Agnieszka G.; Scheraga, Harold A.] Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Scheraga, HA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Baker Lab Chem & Chem Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",has5@cornell.edu,"Krupa, Pawel/S-2292-2016; Mozolewska, Magdalena/E-1895-2016; Slusarz, Rafal/P-2107-2017; Sieradzan, Adam/ABC-3552-2020; He, Yi/H-2324-2012; Czaplewski, Cezary/E-1503-2016","Krupa, Pawel/0000-0002-9710-7837; Mozolewska, Magdalena/0000-0001-7190-7951; Slusarz, Rafal/0000-0003-3335-9047; Sieradzan, Adam/0000-0002-2426-3644; Czaplewski, Cezary/0000-0002-0294-3403; Wisniewska, Marta/0000-0001-8986-3432; Karczynska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2327-9537; Gieldon, Artur/0000-0003-0415-9214; Slusarz, Magdalena J./0000-0002-9411-4679; He, Yi/0000-0002-6884-5312; Liwo, Adam/0000-0001-6942-2226","Polish National Science Centre [UMO-2012/06/A/ST4/00376, UMO-2015/17/N/ST4/03937]; Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)Foundation for Polish Science [Mistrz 7./2013]; US National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [GM-14312]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB10-19767]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312, R01GM014312] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by grant UMO-2012/06/A/ST4/00376 and grant UMO-2015/17/N/ST4/03937 from the Polish National Science Centre, by grant Mistrz 7./2013 from the Foundation for Polish Science (FNP), by grants from the US National Institutes of Health (GM-14312) and the US National Science Foundation (MCB10-19767).

However, it has not always been clear that force fields developed independently of solvation models can together accurately predict secondary structure and folding, and whether the separate influences of the solvation and force field models can be described as independent and additive (versus synergistic). Here, we test two implicit solvation models with several recently developed protein force fields, within the AMBER simulation package. We create a representative set of five helical and five hairpin peptides, 11-20 amino acid residues in length, and calculate folded structures using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations for all force field/solvent/peptide combinations, each with two instances using distinct starting configurations. In general, we find that no force field/solvent combination successfully folds all peptides and that the hairpin peptides are more difficult to capture. That being said, the older ff96/igb5* combination does a reasonable job in folding multiple secondary structures, while ff14SB/igb5* and ff14ipq/igb8 work well for helical and hairpin motifs, respectively. All combinations give rise to similar numbers of salt bridges, except for solvent models paired with ff14ipq, which slightly enhances them. Interestingly, we are unable statistically to decouple the effects of force field, solvent model, and peptide secondary structure on performance, such that particular combinations can have specific effects. These results suggest that future efforts might benefit from codevelopment of implicit models with force fields or from the use of emerging coarse-graining strategies that extract solvation effects in a bottom-up manner.","[Robinson, Melina K.; Monroe, Jacob I.; Shell, M.

The folding/unfolding transitions of many proteins occur, however, in multiple discrete steps associated with the formation of intermediates, which is indicative of reduced cooperativity. Furthermore, much advancement in experimental and computational approaches has demonstrated entirely non-cooperative (gradual) transitions via a continuum of states and a multitude of small energetic barriers between the N and U states of some proteins. These findings have been instrumental towards providing a structural rationale for cooperative versus noncooperative transitions, based on the coupling between interaction networks in proteins. The cooperativity inherent in a folding/unfolding reaction appears to be context dependent, and can be tuned via experimental conditions which change the stabilities of N and U. The evolution of cooperativity in protein folding transitions is linked closely to the evolution of function as well as the aggregation propensity of the protein. A large activation energy barrier in a fully cooperative transition can provide the kinetic control required to prevent the accumulation of partially unfolded forms, which may promote aggregation. Nevertheless, increasing evidence for barrier-less downhill folding, as well as for continuous uphill unfolding transitions, indicate that gradual non-cooperative processes may be ubiquitous features on the free energy landscape of protein folding.","[Malhotra, Pooja; Udgaonkar, Jayant B.] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, India","Udgaonkar, JB (corresponding author), Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bengaluru 560065, India.",jayant@ncbs.res.in,,,"JC Bose National Research Fellowship, Government of India; Tata Institute of Fundamental ResearchTata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); Department of Science and TechnologyDepartment of Science & Technology (India); Department of Biotechnology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) India","Grant sponsors: JC Bose National Research Fellowship, Government of India, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Department of Science and Technology, and the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.",,225,28,28,3,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0961-8368,1469-896X,,PROTEIN SCI,Protein Sci.,NOV,2016,25,11,,,,,1924,1941,,10.1002/pro.3015,,,18,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,EB1YE,WOS:000387151900003,27522064,"Green Published, Bronze",,,19/11/2020

The extensive sampling of protein conformations afforded by such simulations revealed, however, considerable compaction of the protein conformations in the unfolded state, which is inconsistent with experiment. Here, we show that a set of surgical corrections to nonbonded interactions between amine nitrogen-carboxylate oxygen and aliphatic carbon-carbon atom pairs can considerably improve the realism of protein folding simulations. Specifically, we show that employing our corrections in similar to 500 mu s all-atom replica-exchange MD simulations of the WW domain and villin head piece proteins increases the size of the denatured proteins' conformations and does not destabilize the native conformations of the proteins. In addition to making the folded conformations a global minimum of the respective free energy landscapes at room temperature, our corrections also make the free energy landscape smoother, considerably accelerating the folding kinetics and, hence, reducing the computational expense of a protein folding simulation.","[Yoo, Jejoong; Aksimentiev, Aleksei] Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Ctr Phys Living Cells, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Aksimentiev, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Phys, Ctr Phys Living Cells, 1110 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",aksiment@illinois.edu,"Yoo, Jejoong/G-5957-2010","Yoo, Jejoong/0000-0001-7120-8464; Aksimentiev, Aleksei/0000-0002-6042-8442",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [PHY-1430124],"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant PHY-1430124.

This article reports that in multiple, distinct, independent, unrestricted, unbiased, isobaric-isothermal, and classical MD simulations FF12MC can (i) simulate the experimentally observed flipping between left- and right-handed configurations for C14-C38 of BPTI in solution, (ii) autonomously fold chignolin, CLN025, and Trp-cage with folding times that agree with the experimental values, (iii) simulate subsequent unfolding and refolding of these miniproteins, and (iv) achieve a robust Z score of 1.33 for refining protein models TMR01, TMR04, and TMR07. By comparison, the latest general-purpose AMBER forcefield FF14SB locks the C14-C38 bond to the right-handed configuration in solution under the same protein simulation conditions. Statistical survival analysis shows that FF12MC folds chignolin and CLN025 in isobaric-isothermal MD simulations 2-4 times faster than FF14SB under the same protein simulation conditions.

Despite many studies, there is no efficient treatment against Chagas disease, and the search for new therapeutic targets specific to T. cruzi is critical for drug development. Here, we have revisited 41 protein sequences proposed by the analogous enzyme pipeline, and found that it is possible to provide structures for T. cruzi sequences with clear homologs or analogs in H. sapiens and likely associated with trypanothione reductase, cysteine synthase, and ATPase functions, and structures for sequences specific to T. cruzi and absent in H. sapiens associated with 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and leishmanolysin activities. The implications of our structures refined by atomistic molecular dynamics (monomer or dimer states) in their in vitro environments (aqueous solution or membrane bilayers) are discussed for drug development and suggest that all protein targets, except cysteine synthase, merit further investigation.","[Lima, Carlyle Ribeiro; Tuffery, Pierre] Univ Paris Diderot, Mol Therapeut Silico, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM,UMR S 973, F-75013 Paris, France; [Lima, Carlyle Ribeiro; Derreumaux, Philippe] Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Biochim Theor, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Biol Physicochim,CNRS,UPR 9080, F-75005 Paris, France; [Carels, Nicolas] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz FIOCRUZ, Lab Modelagem Sistemas Biol, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Innovat Neglected Dis INC, CDTS, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Ramos Guimaraes, Ana Carolina] Fiocruz MS, IOC, Lab Genom Func & Bioinformat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Tuffery, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Mol Therapeut Silico, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM,UMR S 973, F-75013 Paris, France.; Derreumaux, P (corresponding author), Univ Paris Diderot, Lab Biochim Theor, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Inst Biol Physicochim,CNRS,UPR 9080, F-75005 Paris, France.",pierre.tuffery@univ-paris-diderot.fr; philippe.derreumaux@ibpc.fr,"Derreumaux, Philippe/E-9036-2019; Carels, Nicolas/L-4687-2016; Tuffery, Pierre/L-6953-2017; Guimaraes, Ana Carolina Ramos/P-7914-2018","Carels, Nicolas/0000-0003-4547-7155; Tuffery, Pierre/0000-0003-1033-9895; Guimaraes, Ana Carolina Ramos/0000-0003-1260-543X",CAPES/CsF and Science without Borders PhD grant program from Brazil [11917/13-0],"C.L. thanks CAPES/CsF and Science without Borders PhD grant program from Brazil, BEX Process 11917/13-0.",,82,5,5,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2940,0948-5023,,J MOL MODEL,J.

Guided by these naturally self-assembling supramolecular systems, we have designed a matrix-derived protein chimera that contains a laminin globular-like (LG) domain fused to an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). This bipartite design offers a flexible protein engineering platform: (i) laminin is a key multifunctional component of the ECM in human brains and other neural tissues, making it an ideal bioactive component of our fusion, and (ii) ELPs, known to be well-tolerated in vivo, provide a self-assembly scaffold with tunable physicochemical (viscoelastic, thermoresponsive) properties. Experimental characterization of novel proteins is resource-intensive, and examining many conceivable designs would be a formidable challenge in the laboratory. Computational approaches offer a way forward: molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to analyze the structural/physical behavior of candidate LG-ELP fusion proteins, particularly in terms of conformational properties salient to our design goals, such as assembly propensity in a temperature range spanning the inverse temperature transition. As a first step in examining the physical characteristics of a model LG-ELP fusion protein, including its temperature-dependent structural behavior, we simulated the protein over a range of physiologically relevant temperatures (290-320 K). We find that the ELP region, built upon the archetypal (VPGXG)(5) scaffold, is quite flexible and has a propensity for beta-rich secondary structures near physiological (310-315 K) temperatures. Our trajectories indicate that the temperature-dependent burial of hydrophobic patches in the ELP region, coupled to the local water structure dynamics and mediated by intramolecular contacts between aliphatic side chains, correlates with the temperature dependent structural transitions in known ELP polymers. Because of the link between compaction of ELP segments into beta-rich structures and differential solvation properties of this region, we posit that future variation of ELP sequence and composition can be used to systematically alter the phase transition profiles and, thus, the general functionality of our LG-ELP fusion protein system.","[Tang, James D.; Lampe, Kyle J.] Univ Virginia, Dept Chem Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [McAnany, Charles E.; Mura, Cameron] Univ Virginia, Dept Chem, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Lampe, KJ (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Chem Engn, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",lampe@virginia.edu,"Mura, Cameron/F-5872-2010","Mura, Cameron/0000-0001-7985-2561",UVa; Jeffress Memorial Trust [J-971]; Jeffress Memorial and Carman Trust [2016jeffress.Carman.7644]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1350957]; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1350957] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank K.

Here, we use steered molecular dynamics simulations along with the umbrella sampling technique to elucidate the mechanism of unfolding of chicken villin headpiece (HP-36) in these two denaturants. We find that while urea denatures protein predominantly by forming hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone, GdmCl commences unfolding by weakening of the hydrophobic interactions present in the core. The potential of mean force calculation indicates the reduction of hydrophobic interactions between two benzene moieties in 6 M GdmCl as compared to 6 M urea. We observe a near parallel orientation between the guanidinium cation and aromatic side chains of the HP-36 suggesting pi-cation type stacking interactions which play a crucial role in weakening of the hydrophobic interaction. We use QM/MM optimization calculations to estimate the energetics of this pi-cation interaction. Additionally, the consistency of the unfolding paths between high temperature (400 K) unfolding simulations and steered molecular dynamics simulations strengthens the proposed molecular mechanism of unfolding further.","[Parui, Sridip; Manna, Rabindra Nath; Jana, Biman] Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Kolkata 700032, India","Jana, B (corresponding author), Indian Assoc Cultivat Sci, Dept Phys Chem, Kolkata 700032, India.",pcbj@iacs.res.in,,"Parui, Sridip/0000-0003-0906-963X; Manna, Rabindra Nath/0000-0001-5518-8985",CSIRCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India,"S.P., R.N.M., and B.J. thank the supercomputing facility CRAY at IACS for computational support.

While static charge models can answer many questions regarding protein conformational equilibrium and protein-ligand interactions, pH-sensitive phenomena such as acid-activated chaperones and amyloidogenic protein aggregation are inaccessible to such models. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CPHMD) coupled with the Generalized Born with a Simple sWitching function (GBSW) implicit solvent model provide an accurate framework for simulating pH sensitive processes in biological systems. Although this combination has demonstrated success in predicting pK(a) values of protein structures, and in exploring dynamics of ionizable side-chains, its speed has been an impediment to routine application. The recent availability of low-cost graphics processing unit (GPU) chipsets with thousands of processing cores, together with the implementation of the accurate GBSW implicit solvent model on those chipsets (Arthur and Brooks, J. Comput. Chem. 2016, 37, 927), provide an opportunity to improve the speed of CPHMD and ionization modeling greatly. Here, we present a first implementation of GPU-enabled CPHMD within the CHARMM-OpenMM simulation package interface. Depending on the system size and nonbonded force cutoff parameters, we find speed increases of between one and three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the algorithm scales better with system size than the CPU-based algorithm, thus allowing for larger systems to be modeled in a cost effective manner. We anticipate that the improved performance of this methodology will open the door for broad-spread application of CPHMD in its modeling pH-mediated biological processes.

We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence of high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy barriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more discrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native structure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached when a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of substructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This approach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding pathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a folding reaction.

Ultrafast kinetic methods turned the field upside down by providing the means to probe fundamental aspects of folding, test theoretical predictions and benchmark simulations. Accordingly, experimentalists could measure the timescales for all relevant folding motions, determine the folding speed limit and confirm that folding barriers are entropic bottlenecks. Moreover, a catalogue of proteins that fold extremely fast (microseconds) could be identified. Such fast-folding proteins cross shallow free energy barriers or fold downhill, and thus unfold with minimal co-operativity (gradually). A new generation of thermodynamic methods has exploited this property to map folding landscapes, interaction networks and mechanisms at nearly atomic resolution. In parallel, modern molecular dynamics simulations have finally reached the timescales required to watch fast-folding proteins fold and unfold in silico. All of these findings have buttressed the fundamentals of protein folding predicted by theory, and are now offering the first glimpses at the underlying mechanisms. Fast folding appears to also have functional implications as recent results connect downhill folding with intrinsically disordered proteins, their complex binding modes and ability to moonlight. These connections suggest that the coupling between downhill (un)folding and binding enables such protein domains to operate analogically as conformational rheostats.","[Munoz, Victor; Cerminara, Michele] CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Munoz, Victor; Cerminara, Michele] IMDEA Nanosci Inst, Calle Faraday 9, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Munoz, Victor] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA","Munoz, V (corresponding author), CSIC, Natl Biotechnol Ctr, Darwin 3, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), IMDEA Nanosci Inst, Calle Faraday 9, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.; Munoz, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif Merced, Sch Engn, 5200 N Lake Rd, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",vmunoz@cnb.csic.es,,,"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness [CSD2009-00088, BIO2011-28092]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2012-ADG-323059]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1616759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Molecular and Cellular BioscienceNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1616759] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness [grant numbers CSD2009-00088 and BIO2011-28092] and the European Research Council [grant number ERC-2012-ADG-323059].,,205,32,32,0,27,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"5TH FLR, 90 HIGH HOLBORN, LONDON WC1V 6LJ, ENGLAND",0264-6021,1470-8728,,BIOCHEM J,Biochem.

However, this measure of modelability of a protein sequence into its structure may be misleading. Addressing this limitation, we propose here a 'structural difficulty (SD)' index, which is derived from secondary structures, homology and physicochemical features of protein sequences. The SD index reflects the capability of predicting accurate structures and helps to assess the potential for developing proteome level structural databases for various organisms with some of the best methodologies available currently. For instance, the plausibility of populating the structural database of human proteome with reliable quality structures under 3 angstrom root mean square deviation from the corresponding natives is found to be similar to 37% of a total of 11 084 manually curated soluble proteins and similar to 64% for all annotated and reviewed unique soluble protein (344 661 sequences) of UniProtKB. Also for 77 human pathogenic viruses comprising 2365 globular viral proteins out of which only 162 structures are solved experimentally, SD index scores 1336 proteins in the modelable zone.

To understand these interactions, it is necessary to know the three-dimensional structures of RNA-protein complexes. However, determining the tertiary structure of these complexes is often difficult, suggesting that an accurate rigid body docking for RNA-protein complexes is needed. In general, the rigid body docking process is divided into two steps: generating candidate structures from the individual RNA and protein structures and then narrowing down the candidates. In this study, we focus on the former problem to improve the prediction accuracy in RNA-protein docking. Our method is based on the integration of physicochemical information about RNA into ZDOCK, which is known as one of the most successful computer programs for protein protein docking. Because recent studies showed the current force field for molecular dynamics simulation of protein and nucleic acids is quite accurate, we modeled the physicochemical information about RNA by force fields such as AMBER and CHARMM. A comprehensive benchmark of RNA-protein docking, using three recently developed data sets, reveals the remarkable prediction accuracy of the proposed method compared with existing programs for docking: the highest success rate is 34.7% for the predicted structure of the RNA-protein complex with the best score and 79.2% for 3,600 predicted ones. Three full atomistic force fields for RNA (AMBER94, AMBER99, and CHARMM22) produced almost the same accurate result, which showed current force fields for nucleic acids are quite accurate. In addition, we found that the electrostatic interaction and the representation of shape complementary between protein and RNA plays the important roles for accurate prediction of the native structures of RNA-protein complexes.","[Iwakiri, Junichi; Asai, Kiyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Hamada, Michiaki] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Elect Engn & Biosci, Shinjuku Ku, 55N-06-10,3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Hamada, Michiaki; Asai, Kiyoshi; Kameda, Tomoshi] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Koto Ku, 2-4-7 Aomi, Tokyo 1350064, Japan","Kameda, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence Res Ctr, Koto Ku, 2-4-7 Aomi, Tokyo 1350064, Japan.",kameda-tomoshi@aist.go.jp,"Hamada, Michiaki/L-9371-2018; Asai, Kiyoshi/AAT-8344-2020; Kameda, Tomoshi/M-2143-2018","Hamada, Michiaki/0000-0001-9466-1034; Asai, Kiyoshi/0000-0003-0909-4982; Kameda, Tomoshi/0000-0001-9508-5366; Iwakiri, Junichi/0000-0002-4611-2142","MEXT KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25240044, 24680031, 40415774]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [221S0002]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25240044, 16H06279] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was supported by MEXT KAKENHI Grant Numbers 25240044 (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) to K.A., in part), 24680031 (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) to M.H., in part), and 40415774 (Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) to T.K., in part) and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (221S0002) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.",,53,14,15,1,23,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

In this research study, long-range all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were engaged for the bound and the unbound proteins to enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the Hsp90 dimerization and inhibition. Results evidently showed that coumermycin A1 (C-A1), a recently discovered Hsp90 inhibitor, binds at the dimer's active site of the Hsp90 protein and leads to a substantial parting between dimeric opposed residues, which include Arg591.B, Lys594.A, Ser663.A, Thr653.B, Ala665.A, Thr649.B, Leu646.B and Asn669.A. Significant differences in magnitudes were observed in radius of gyration, root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation, which confirms a reasonably more flexible state in the apo conformation associated with it dimerization. In contrast, the bound conformer of Hsp90 showed less flexibility. This visibly highpoints the inhibition process resulting from the binding of the ligand. These findings were further validated by principal component analysis. We believe that the detailed dynamic analyses of Hsp90 presented in this study, would give an imperative insight and better understanding to the function and mechanisms of inhibition. Furthermore, information obtained from the binding mode of the inhibitor would be of great assistance in the design of more potent inhibitors against the HIV target Hsp90.","[Cele, Favourite N.; Kumalo, Hezekiel; Soliman, Mahmoud E.

Aggregation of mAbs continues to be a major problem in their developability. Antibody aggregation could be triggered by partial unfolding of its domains, leading to monomer-monomer association followed by nucleation and growth. Although the aggregation propensities of antibodies and antibody-based proteins can be affected by the external experimental conditions, they are strongly dependent on the intrinsic antibody properties as determined by their sequences and structures. In this review, we describe how the unfolding and aggregation susceptibilities of IgG could be related to their cognate sequences and structures. The impact of antibody domain structures on thermostability and aggregation propensities, and effective strategies to reduce aggregation are discussed. Finally, the aggregation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as related to their sequence/structure, linker payload, conjugation chemistry and drug-antibody ratio (DAR) is reviewed.","[Li, Wei; Chen, Weizao; Zhu, Zhongyu; Feng, Yang; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.] NCI, Prot Interact Sect, Canc & Inflammat Program, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA; [Prabakaran, Ponraj] Intrexon Corp, Germantown, MD 20876 USA","Li, W (corresponding author), NCI, Prot Interact Sect, Canc & Inflammat Program, Ctr Canc Res,NIH, Frederick, MD 21702 USA.",wei.li3@nih.gov; praba.ponraj@gmail.com; chenw3@mail.nih.gov; zhuzhongyu@mail.nih.gov; fengya@mail.nih.gov; dimitrdi@mail.nih.gov,"Ponraj, Prabakaran/D-6325-2011; Ponraj, Prabakaran/AAS-6433-2020","Ponraj, Prabakaran/0000-0002-4049-4813; ","Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Program (IATAP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research; U.S.-China Program for Biomedical Research Cooperation; U.S.-China Program for Research Toward a Cure for HIV/AIDS","We thank Hongjia Yang for help with the manuscript.

The memory information from the protein data bank (PDB) database guides proper protein folding. The structural information about available sequences in the database varies in quality and can sometimes lead to frustrated free energy landscapes locally. One way out of this difficulty is to construct the input fragment memory information from all-atom simulations of portions of the complete polypeptide chain. In this paper, we investigate this approach first put forward by Kwac and Wolynes in a more complete way by studying the structure prediction capabilities of this approach for six alpha-helical proteins. This scheme which we call the atomistic associative memory, water mediated, structure and energy model (AAWSEM) amounts to an ab initio protein structure prediction method that starts from the ground up without using bioinformatic input. The free energy profiles from AAWSEM show that atomistic fragment memories are sufficient to guide the correct folding when tertiary forces are included. AAWSEM combines the efficiency of coarse-grained simulations on the full protein level with the local structural accuracy achievable from all-atom simulations of only parts of a large protein. The results suggest that a hybrid use of atomistic fragment memory and database memory in structural predictions may well be optimal for many practical applications.","[Chen, Mingchen; Lin, Xingcheng; Zheng, Weihua; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Lin, Xingcheng; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Chen, Mingchen] Rice Univ, Dept Bioengn, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Zheng, Weihua; Onuchic, Jose N.; Wolynes, Peter G.] Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA","Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Ctr Theoret Biol Phys, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, Houston, TX 77005 USA.; Wolynes, PG (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Chem, POB 1892, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",pwolynes@rice.edu,"Lin, Xingcheng/N-9395-2018","Lin, Xingcheng/0000-0002-9378-6174; Chen, Mingchen/0000-0003-3916-7871","National Institute of General Medical SciencesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM 44557]; Center for Theoretical Biological Physics - NSF [PHY-1427654]; D.R.

We demonstrate the use of this protocol on both a protein and a DNA case study.

However, MSMs may require significant tuning and can yield biased results. Here, by analyzing some of the longest protein MD data sets available (>100 mu s per protein), we show that estimators constructed based on exact non-Markovian (NM) principles can yield significantly improved mean first-passage times (MFPTs) for protein folding and unfolding. In some cases, MSM bias of more than an order of magnitude can be corrected when identical trajectory data are reanalyzed by non-Markovian approaches. The NM analysis includes history information, higher order time correlations compared to MSMs, that is available in every MD trajectory. The NM strategy is insensitive to fine details of the states used and works well when a fine time-discretization (i.e., small lag time) is used.","[Suarez, Ernesto; Zuckerman, Daniel M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Adelman, Joshua L.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Zuckerman, DM (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Computat & Syst Biol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",ddmmzz@pitt.edu,,,"NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM115805, P41GM103712]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1119091]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM115805, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM115805, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, R01GM115805, P41GM103712, R01GM115805, P41GM103712, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, R01GM115805, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712, P41GM103712] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was partially supported by NIH Grants R01GM115805 and P41GM103712, as well as NSF Grant MCB-1119091.",,39,25,25,1,23,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1549-9618,1549-9626,,J CHEM THEORY COMPUT,J.

While sharing 88 % sequence identity and differing by only seven residues, GA88 and GB88 have completely different structures and serve as ideal systems for investigating the relationship between sequence and function. Benefiting from the continuous advancement of the computational ability of modern computers, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is now playing an increasingly important role in the study of proteins. However, the reliability of MD simulations is limited by the accuracy of the force fields and solvent model approximations. In this work, several AMBER force fields (AMBER03, AMBER99SB, AMBER12SB, AMBER14SB, AMBER96) and solvent models (TIP3P, IGB5, IGB7, IGB8) have been employed in the simulations of GA88 and GB88. The statistical results from 19 simulations show that GA88 and GB88 both adopt more compact structures than the native structures. GB88 is more stable than GA88 regardless of the force fields and solvent models utilized. Most of the simulations overestimated the salt bridge interaction. The combination of AMBER14SB force field and IGB8 solvent model shows the best overall performance in the simulations of both GA88 and GB88. AMBER03 and AMBER12SB also yield reasonable results but only in the TIP3P explicit solvent model.","[Zeng, Juan] Peking Univ, Lab Computat Chem & Drug Design, Lab Chem Genom, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongxiu] South Cent Univ Nationalities, State Ethn Affairs Commiss, Key Lab Catalysis & Mat Sci, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongxiu] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Zhang, John Z.

Here, we examine the feasibility of developing a flexible protein model within the MARTINI framework. The results demonstrate that the MARTINI CG scheme does not properly describe the volume and packing of protein backbone and side chains and leads to excessive collapse without structural restraints in explicit CG water. Combining atomistic protein representation with the MARTINI CG solvent, such as in the PACE model, dramatically improves description of flexible protein conformations. Yet, the CG solvent is insufficient to capture the conformational dependence of protein-solvent interactions, and PACE is unable to properly model context dependent conformational transitions. Taken together, high physical resolution at or near the atomistic level is likely necessary for flexible protein models with explicit, microscopic solvents, and the coarse-graining needs to focus on possible simplification in interaction potentials.

The methods introduced here are those that have been or will be applied to biomolecular binding, where the biomolecules are treated as flexible molecules expressed by an all-atom model in an explicit solvent. Sampling produces an ensemble of conformations (snapshots) that are thermodynamically probable at room temperature. Then, projection of those conformations to an abstract low-dimensional space generates a free-energy landscape. As an example, we show a landscape of homo-dimer formation of an endothelin-1-like molecule computed using a generalized ensemble method. The lowest free-energy cluster at room temperature coincided precisely with the experimentally determined complex structure. Two minor clusters were also found in the landscape, which were largely different from the native complex form. Although those clusters were isolated at room temperature, with rising temperature a pathway emerged linking the lowest and second-lowest free-energy clusters, and a further temperature increment connected all the clusters. This exemplifies that the generalized ensemble method is a powerful tool for computing the free-energy landscape, by which one can discuss the thermodynamic stability of clusters and the temperature dependence of the cluster networks.","[Iida, Shinji; Nakamura, Haruki; Higo, Junichi] Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan","Higo, J (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Inst Prot Res, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",higo@protein.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [21113006]; development of core technologies for innovative drug development based on IT from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [24118001]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K05517] Funding Source: KAKEN","J.

Researchers in these fields continue to turn to more advanced techniques such as NMR, mass spectrometry, molecular dynamics (MD) and singlemolecule methods to interrogate how proteins fold. Our understanding of beta-barrel outer membrane protein (OMP) folding has benefited from these advances in the last decade. This class of proteins must traverse the periplasm and then insert into an asymmetric lipid membrane in the absence of a chemical energy source. In this review we discuss old, new and emerging techniques used to examine the process of OMP folding and biogenesis in vitro and describe some of the insights and new questions these techniques have revealed.","[Horne, Jim E.; Radford, Sheena E.] Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Horne, Jim E.; Radford, Sheena E.] Univ Leeds, Sch Mol & Cellular Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England","Radford, SE (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Astbury Ctr Struct Mol Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.; Radford, SE (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Mol & Cellular Biol, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.e.radford@leeds.ac.uk,,"Horne, Jim/0000-0001-5260-2634",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) White Rose DTPBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/M011151/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [1646705] Funding Source: researchfish,This work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) White Rose DTP [grant number BB/M011151/1 (to J.E.H.)].,,77,8,8,0,17,PORTLAND PRESS LTD,LONDON,"CHARLES DARWIN HOUSE, 12 ROGER STREET, LONDON WC1N 2JU, ENGLAND",0300-5127,1470-8752,,BIOCHEM SOC T,Biochem.

However, obtaining quantitative measurements of thermodynamic observables from unbiased classical simulations of peptide or protein adsorption is challenging because of sampling limitations brought on by strong biomolecule/surface binding forces as well as time scale limitations. We used the parallel tempering metadynamics in the well-tempered ensemble (PTMetaD-WTE) enhanced sampling method to study the adsorption behavior and thermodynamics of several explicitly solvated model peptide adsorption systems, providing new molecular-level insight into the biomolecule adsorption process. Specifically studied were peptides LK alpha 14 and LK beta 15 and trpcage miniprotein adsorbing onto a charged, hydrophilic self-assembled monolayer surface functionalized with a carboxylic acid/carboxylate headgroup and a neutral, hydrophobic methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer surface. Binding free energies were calculated as a function of temperature for each system and decomposed into their respective energetic and entropic contributions. We investigated how specific interfacial features such as peptide/surface electrostatic interactions and surface-bound ion content affect the thermodynamic landscape of adsorption and lead to differences in surface-bound conformations of the peptides. Results show that upon adsorption to the charged surface, configurational entropy gains of the released solvent molecules dominate the configurational entropy losses of the bound peptide. This behavior leads to an apparent increase in overall system entropy upon binding and therefore to the surprising and seemingly nonphysical result of an apparent increased binding free energy at elevated temperatures. Opposite effects and conclusions are found for the neutral surface. Additional simulations demonstrate that by adjusting the ionic strength of the solution, results that show the expected physical behavior, i.e., peptide binding strength that decreases with increasing temperature or is independent of temperature altogether, can be recovered on the charged surface. On the basis of this analysis, an overall free energy for the entire thermodynamic cycle for peptide adsorption on charged surfaces is constructed and validated with independent simulations.","[Sprenger, K.

Recent evidence suggests alpha-structure is relatively minor among three major backbone conformations for unfolded proteins. The alpha-helices are the dominant structures in many proteins. For these proteins, how could the alpha-structures occur from the least in unfolded to the most in folded states? Populations of the minor alpha-conformation in model peptides provide vital information. Reliable determination of populations of the alpha-conformers in these peptides that exist in multiple equilibriums of different conformations remains a challenge. Combined analyses on data from AcGXPNH(2) and AcGXGNH(2) peptides allow us to derive the populations of PII, beta and a in AcGXGNH(2). Our results show that on average residue X in AcGXGNH2 adopt PII, beta, and a 44.7%, 44.5% and 10.8% of time, respectively. The contents of alpha-conformations for different amino acids define an alpha-helix nucleation propensity scale. With derived PII, beta and alpha-contents, we can construct a free energy-conformation diagram on each AcGXGNH(2) in aqueous solution for the three major backbone conformations. Our results would have broad implications on early-stage events of protein folding.","[Zhou, Yanjun; He, Liu; Zhang, Wenwen; Hu, Jingjing; Shi, Zhengshuang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China","Shi, ZS (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",zs_shi@hust.edu.cn,,"Shi, Zhengshuang/0000-0002-8731-8593",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21272081],"The authors are grateful to the Analytical and Testing Center of HUST.

At the same time, recent simulations and experiments reveal a complex structural landscape with a rich set of local motions and conformational changes. We couple experimental kinetic and thermodynamic measurements with specifically tailored analysis of simulation data to isolate local versus global folding probes. We find that local probes exhibit lower melting temperatures, smaller surface area changes, and faster kinetics compared to global ones. We also see that certain local probes of folding match the global behavior more closely than others.

It is a difficult problem due to its combinatorial nature. We study the performance of an MMGBSA energy function, implemented in our protein design program Proteus, which combines molecular mechanics terms, a Generalized Born and Surface Area (GBSA) solvent model, with approximations that make the model pairwise additive. Proteus is not a competitor to specialized side chain prediction programs due to its cost, but it allows protein design applications, where side chain prediction is an important step and MMGBSA an effective energy model. We predict the side chain conformations for 18 proteins. The side chains are first predicted individually, with the rest of the protein in its crystallographic conformation. Next, all side chains are predicted together. The contributions of individual energy terms are evaluated and various parameterizations are compared. We find that the GB and SA terms, with an appropriate choice of the dielectric constant and surface energy coefficients, are beneficial for single side chain predictions. For the prediction of all side chains, however, errors due to the pairwise additive approximation overcome the improvement brought by these terms. We also show the crucial contribution of side chain minimization to alleviate the rigid rotamer approximation. Even without GB and SA terms, we obtain accuracies comparable to SCWRL4, a specialized side chain prediction program. In particular, we obtain a better RMSD than SCWRL4 for core residues (at a higher cost), despite our simpler rotamer library.

Much of the investigation of protein evolution has focused on mutations that leave a protein's folded structure essentially unchanged. However, to evolve novel folds of proteins, mutations that lead to large conformational modifications have to be involved. Unraveling the basic biophysics of such mutations is a challenge to theory, especially when only one or two amino acid substitutions cause a large-scale conformational switch. Among the few such mutational switches identified experimentally, the one between the G(A) all-alpha and G(B) alpha+beta folds is extensively characterized; but all-atom simulations using fully transferrable potentials have not been able to account for this striking switching behavior. Here we introduce an explicit-chain model that combines structure-based native biases for multiple alternative structures with a general physical atomic force field, and apply this construct to twelve mutants spanning the sequence variation between G(A) and G(B). In agreement with experiment, we observe conformational switching from G(A) to G(B) upon a single L45Y substitution in the GA98 mutant. In line with the latent evolutionary potential concept, our model shows a gradual sequence-dependent change in fold preference in the mutants before this switch. Our analysis also indicates that a sharp G(A)/G(B) switch may arise from the orientation dependence of aromatic p-interactions. These findings provide physical insights toward rationalizing, predicting and designing evolutionary conformational switches.","[Sikosek, Tobias; Krobath, Heinrich; Chan, Hue Sun] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada","Chan, HS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem & Mol Genet, Toronto, ON, Canada.",chan@arrhenius.med.toronto.edu,"Sikosek, Tobias/E-4939-2014","Sikosek, Tobias/0000-0001-9929-3525; Krobath, Heinrich/0000-0001-6473-8109",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-84281],"This work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html) grant MOP-84281 to HSC.

NMR derived Lipari-Szabo squared generalized order parameter (O-2) values of amide NAH bond vectors of the polypeptide chain were also often employed for refinement and validation. However, with a few exceptions, side chain methyl symmetry axis order parameters have not been incorporated into experimental reference sets. Using a test set of five diverse proteins, the performance of several force fields implemented in the NAMDD simulation package was examined. It was found that simulations employing explicit water implemented using the TIP3 model generally performed significantly better than those using implicit water in reproducing experimental methyl symmetry axis O-2 values. Overall the CHARMM27 force field performs nominally better than two implementations of the Amber force field.

ISs are obtained by minimizing the sampled conformations into local minima on potential/effective energy surface. The conformations that are minimized into the same energy basin belong to one cluster. We investigate the influence of the applications of these two methods of trajectory decomposition on our understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of alanine tetrapeptide. We find that at the microcluster level, the IS approach and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)-based clustering method give totally different results. Depending on the local features of energy landscape, the conformations with close RMSDs can be minimized into different minima, while the conformations with large RMSDs could be minimized into the same basin. However, the relaxation time-scales calculated based on the transition matrices built from the microclusters are similar. The discrepancy at the microcluster level leads to different macroclusters. Although the dynamic models established through both clustering methods are validated approximately Markovian, the IS approach seems to give a meaningful state space discretization at the macrocluster level in terms of conformational features and kinetics.

They are, therefore, suitable for capturing generic features of protein folding and amyloid formation at low computational cost. As our aim is to study the critical nucleus sizes of two experimentally well-characterized peptide fragments A beta(16-22) and A beta(37-42) of the full length A beta(1-42) Alzheimer's peptide, it is important that simulations with the lattice model reproduce all-atom simulations. In this study, we present a comprehensive force field parameterization based on the OPEP (Optimized Potential for Efficient protein structure Prediction) force field for an on-lattice protein model, which incorporates explicitly the formation of hydrogen bonds and directions of side-chains. Our bottom-up approach starts with the determination of the best lattice force parameters for the A beta(16-22) dimer by fitting its equilibrium parallel and anti-parallel beta-sheet populations to all-atom simulation results. Surprisingly, the calibrated force field is transferable to the trimer of A beta(16-22) and the dimer and trimer of A beta(37-42). Encouraged by this finding, we characterized the free energy landscapes of the two decamers. The dominant structure of the A beta(16-22) decamer matches the microcrystal structure. Pushing the simulations for aggregates between 4-mer and 12-mer suggests a nucleus size for fibril formation of 10 chains. In contrast, the A beta(37-42) decamer is largely disordered with mixed by parallel and antiparallel chains, suggesting that the nucleus size is >10 peptides. Our refined force field coupled to this on-lattice model should provide useful insights into the critical nucleation number associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

The accurate PMF profiles for describing the dihedral rotation of butane under both coordinates of dihedral rotation and root mean square deviation (RMSD) variation were obtained based on the different umbrella samplings from the same TMD simulations. The initial structures for the umbrella samplings can be conveniently selected from the TMD trajectories. For the application of this computational method in the unfolding process of the HP35 protein, the PMF calculation along with the coordinate of the radius of gyration (R-g) presents the gradual increase of free energies by about 1 kcal/mol with the energy fluctuations. The feature of conformational transition for the unfolding process of the HP35 protein shows that the spherical structure extends and the middle alpha-helix unfolds firstly, followed by the unfolding of other alpha-helices.

However the underlying assumptions of the relationship between the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and energetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to benchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable sequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts Hamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce many important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis reveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend not only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds; in particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization of native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing folds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred Potts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able to generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired folds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are remarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are not simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds.

Recently, a de novo designed mini-protein DS119, with a beta alpha beta motif and 36 amino acids, has folded unusually slowly in experiments, and transient dimers have been detected in the folding process. Here, by means of all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations, several comparably stable intermediate states were observed on the folding free-energy landscape of DS119. Conventional molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations showed that when two unfolded DS119 proteins bound together, most binding sites of dimeric aggregates were located at the N-terminal segment, especially residues 5-10, which were supposed to form beta-sheet with its own C-terminal segment. Furthermore, a large percentage of individual proteins in the dimeric aggregates adopted conformations similar to those in the intermediate states observed in REMD simulations. These results indicate that, during the folding process, DS119 can easily become trapped in intermediate states. Then, with diffusion, a transient dimer would be formed and stabilized with the binding interface located at N-terminals. This means that it could not quickly fold to the native structure. The complicated folding manner of DS119 implies the important influence of natural selection on protein-folding kinetics, and more improvement should be achieved in rational protein design.","[Wang, Moye; Hu, Jie; Zhang, Zhuqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, ZQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",wangmoye13@mails.ucas.ac.cn; hujie14@mails.ucas.ac.cn; zhuqingzhang@ucas.ac.cn,,,National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31200548]; President Foundation A of University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,We thank Luhua Lai and Zhirong Liu for helpful discussion.

J. Comput. Chem. 2015, 36, 763-772 and Harada et al. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2015, 630, 68-75] was recently proposed as an enhanced conformational sampling method for reproducing biologically relevant rare events of a given protein. In TBSA, an inverse histogram of the original distribution, mapped onto a set of reaction coordinates, is constructed from trajectories obtained by multiple short-time molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Rarely occurring states of a given protein are statistically selected as new initial states based on the inverse histogram, and resampling is performed by restarting the MD simulations from the new initial states to promote the conformational transition. In this process, the definition of the inverse histogram, which characterizes the rarely occurring states, is crucial for the efficiency of TBSA. In this study, we propose a simple modification of the inverse histogram to further accelerate the convergence of TBSA. As demonstrations of the modified TBSA, we applied it to (a) hydrogen bonding rearrangements of Met-enkephalin, (b) large-amplitude domain motions of Glutamine-Binding Protein, and (c) folding processes of the B domain of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A. All demonstrations numerically proved that the modified TBSA reproduced these biologically relevant rare events with nanosecond-order simulation times, although a set of microsecond-order, canonical MD simulations failed to reproduce the rare events, indicating the high efficiency of the modified TBSA.","[Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Dept Phys, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan; [Harada, Ryuhei; Shigeta, Yasuteru] Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [Harada, Ryuhei] Adv Ctr Comp & Commun, RIKEN, Computat Engn Applicat Unit, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Takano, Yu] Hiroshima City Univ, Dept Biomed Informat Sci, Asaminami Ku, 3-4-1 Ozuka Higashi, Hiroshima, Japan","Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Pure & Appl Sci, Dept Phys, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058571, Japan.; Harada, R; Shigeta, Y (corresponding author), Univ Tsukuba, Ctr Computat Sci, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan.; Harada, R (corresponding author), Adv Ctr Comp & Commun, RIKEN, Computat Engn Applicat Unit, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.; Takano, Y (corresponding author), Hiroshima City Univ, Dept Biomed Informat Sci, Asaminami Ku, 3-4-1 Ozuka Higashi, Hiroshima, Japan.",ryuhei@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp; ytakano@hiroshima-cu.ac.jp; shigeta@ccs.tsukuba.ac.jp,"Shigeta, Yasuteru/D-4714-2015; Takano, Yu/H-1785-2014","Shigeta, Yasuteru/0000-0002-3219-6007; Takano, Yu/0000-0002-4165-8672","Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J03797]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26840056, 26107004, 26105012]; JST, CRESTJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26105001, 16H06164, 15J03797, 26105012, 15K21719] Funding Source: KAKEN","This work was mainly supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS) Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (No. 15J03797) and a JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B), No. 26840056 and was partially supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research of the Innovative Areas Photosynergetics and 3D Active-Site Science (Nos. 26107004 and 26105012) from JSPS and JST, CREST.

Progressive studies imply that abnormality in PHD2 function may be due to misfolding. Therefore, study of the PHD2 unfolding pathway paves the way for a better understanding of the influence of PHD2 mutations and cancer cell metabolites on the protein folding pathway. We study the unfolding of the PHD2 catalytic domain using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and discrete molecular dynamics simulations (DMD). Using computational and experimental techniques, we find that PHD2 undergoes four transitions along the thermal unfolding pathway. To illustrate PHD2 unfolding events in atomic detail, we utilize DMD simulations. Analysis of computational results indicates an intermediate species in the PHD2 unfolding pathway that may enhance aggregation propensity, explaining mutation-independent PHD2 malfunction.

Under aqueous conditions where downhill folding is most likely to occur, we measure the stability of multiple H bonds, using hydrogen exchange (HX) in a lambda(YA) variant that is suggested to be an incipient downhill folder having an extrapolated folding rate constant of 2 x 10(5) s(-1) and a stability of 7.4 kcal.mol(-1) at 298 K. At least one H bond on each of the three largest helices (alpha 1, alpha 3, and alpha 4) breaks during a common unfolding event that reflects global denaturation. The use of HX enables us to both examine folding under highly stabilizing, native-like conditions and probe the pretransition state region for stable species without the need to initiate the folding reaction. The equivalence of the stability determined at zero and high denaturant indicates that any residual denatured state structure minimally affects the stability even under native conditions. Using our psi analysis method along with mutational phi analysis, we find that the three aforementioned helices are all present in the folding transition state. Hence, the free energy surface has a sufficiently high barrier separating the denatured and native states that folding appears cooperative even under extremely stable and fast folding conditions.","[Yu, Wookyung; Baxa, Michael C.; Gagnon, Isabelle; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Baxa, Michael C.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Freed, Karl F.] Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Freed, Karl F.; Sosnick, Tobin R.] Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, 920 E 58Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Inst Biophys Dynam, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Freed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, 5735 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Freed, KF (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, James Franck Inst, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Freed, KF; Sosnick, TR (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Computat Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",freed@uchicago.edu; trsosnic@uchicago.edu,"Freed, Karl F/J-7764-2018","Freed, Karl F/0000-0001-6240-2599; Yu, Wookyung/0000-0001-9835-930X","National Institutes of Health ResearchUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 GM055694]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CHE-1363012]; National Creative Research Initiatives (Center for Proteome Biophysics) of the National Research Foundation, Korea [2011-0000041]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694, R01GM055694] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank M.

Recent microsecond-resolution experiments and long duration (totaling milliseconds) single-trajectory modeling have shown that even mechanistic changes in folding kinetics due to mutation can now be analyzed. Thus, a comprehensive set of experimental data would be helpful to benchmark the predictions made by simulations. Here, we use T-jump relaxation in conjunction with protein engineering and report mutational Phi-values (Phi(M)) as indicators for folding transition-state structure of 65 side chain, 7 backbone hydrogen bond, and 6 deletion and /or insertion mutants within loop 1 of the 34-residue hPin1 WW domain. Forty-five cross-validated consensus mutants could be identified that provide structural constraints for transition-state structure within all substructures of the WW domain fold (hydrophobic core, loop 1, loop 2, beta-sheet). We probe the robustness of the two hydrophobic clusters in the folding transition state, discuss how local backbone disorder in the native-state can lead to non-classical Phi(M)-values (Phi(M) > 1) in the rate-determining loop 1 substructure, and conclusively identify mutations and positions along the sequence that perturb the folding mechanism from loop 1-limited toward loop 2-limited folding.

Nevertheless, elevated temperatures are frequently used to enhance conformational sampling, either during system setup or as a component of an advanced sampling technique such as temperature replica exchange. Because macromolecular force fields are now put upon to simulate temperatures and time scales that greatly exceed their original design specifications, it is appropriate to re-evaluate whether these force fields are up to the task. Here, we quantify the rates of peptide bond isomerization in high-temperature simulations of three octameric peptides and a small fast folding protein. We show that peptide octamers with and without proline residues undergo cis/trans isomerization every 1-5 ns at 800 K with three classical atomistic force fields (AMBER99SB-ILDN, CHARMM22/CMAP, and OPLS-AA/L). On the low microsecond time scale, these force fields permit isomerization of nonprolyl peptide bonds at temperatures >= 500 K, and the CHARMM22/CMAP force field permits isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds >= 400 K. Moreover, the OPLS-AA/L force field allows chiral inversion about the C-alpha atom at 800 K. Finally, we show that temperature replica exchange permits cis peptide bonds developed at 540 K to subsequently migrate back to the 300 K ensemble, where cis peptide. bonds are present in 2 +/- 1% of the population of Trp-cage TC5b, including up to 4% of its folded state. Further work is required to assess the accuracy of cis/trans isomerization in the current generation of protein force fields.","[Neale, Chris; Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Garcia, Angel E.] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Pomes, Regis] Hosp Sick Children, Mol Struct & Funct, 686 Bay St, Toronto, ON M5G 0A4, Canada; [Pomes, Regis] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, 101 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada; [Neale, Chris; Garcia, Angel E.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr NonLinear Studies CNLS, MS B258, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA","Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Phys Appl Phys & Astron, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.; Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Ctr Biotechnol & Interdisciplinary Studies, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.; Garcia, AE (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Ctr NonLinear Studies CNLS, MS B258, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",agarcia@lanl.gov,,,Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)Canada Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Fonds de Recherche Nature et Technologies Quebec; CFI under the auspices of Compute Canada; Government of Ontario; Ontario Research Fund - Research Excellence; University of TorontoUniversity of Toronto; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1053575]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); CIHR OperatingCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [MOP-43998]; NSERC DiscoveryNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [418679]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [MCB-1050966]; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1050966] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"Computations are performed at (i) Colosse at the CLUMEQ high performance computing (HPC) consortium of Calcul Quebec (www.calculquebec.ca), (ii) GPC at the SciNet HPC consortium,99 (iii) the Center for Computational Innovations at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and (iv) Stampede at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin (www.tacc.utexas.edu), to which access is provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE grant TG-MCB130178).

Using molecular dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent model, an ensemble of folding trajectories from unfolded (practically extended) states of the protein to the native state was generated. To get insight into the folding kinetics, the free energy surface and kinetic network projected on this surface were constructed. This, conventional analysis of the folding reaction was followed by a recently proposed hydrodynamic description of protein folding (Chekmarev et al. in Phys Rev Lett 100(1):018107, 2008), in which the process of the first-passage folding is viewed as a stationary flow of a folding fluid from the unfolded to native state. This approach is conceptually different from the previously used approaches and thus allows an alternative view of the folding dynamics and kinetics of Trp-cage, the conclusions about which are very diverse. In agreement with most previous studies, we observed two characteristic folding pathways: in one pathway (I), the collapse of the hydrophobic core precedes the formation of the -helix, and in the other pathway (II), these events occur in the reverse order. We found that although pathway II is complicated by a repeated partial protein unfolding, it contributes to the total folding flow as little as a parts per thousand 10 %, so that the folding kinetics remain essentially single-exponential.","[Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia; [Andryushchenko, Vladimir A.; Chekmarev, Sergei F.] Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia","Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), SB RAS, Inst Thermophys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.; Chekmarev, SF (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Univ, Dept Phys, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.",vladimir.andryushchenko@gmail.com; chekmarev@itp.nsc.ru,,,Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [14-14-00325],This work was performed under a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (No. 14-14-00325).,,58,7,7,2,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0175-7571,1432-1017,,EUR BIOPHYS J BIOPHY,Eur.
